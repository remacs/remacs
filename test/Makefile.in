### Commentary:

## Some targets:
## check: re-run all tests, writing to .log files.
## check-maybe: run all tests which are outdated with their .log file
## or the source files they are testing.
## filename.log: run tests from filename.el(c) if .log file needs updating
## filename: re-run tests from filename.el(c), with no logging

## We need to use $loadfile because:

## ii) Although -l basename will automatically load .el or .elc,
## -l ./basename treats basename as a literal file (it would be nice
## to change this; bug#17848 - if that gets done, this can be simplified).
##
## Beware: it approximates 'no-byte-compile', so watch out for false-positives!
