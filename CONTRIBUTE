* Information for Emacs Developers.

An "Emacs Developer" is someone who contributes a lot of code or
documentation to the Emacs repository. Generally, they have write
access to the Emacs git repository on Savannah
https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs.

** Write access to the Emacs repository.

Once you become a frequent contributor to Emacs, we can consider
giving you write access to the version-control repository. Request
access on the emacs-devel@gnu.org mailing list.

** Using the Emacs repository

Emacs uses git for the source code repository.

See http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GitQuickStartForEmacsDevs to get
started, and http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GitForEmacsDevs for more
advanced information.

Alternately, see admin/notes/git-workflow.

If committing changes written by someone else, make the ChangeLog
entry in their name, not yours. git distinguishes between the author
and the committer; use the --author option on the commit command to
specify the actual author; the committer defaults to you.

** commit messages

When using git, commit messages should use ChangeLog format, with the
following modifications:

- Add a single short line explaining the change, then an empty line,
  then unindented ChangeLog entries.

  You can use various Emacs functions to ease this process; see (info
  "(emacs)Change Log Commands") or
  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Change-Log-Commands.html.

- The summary line is limited to 72 characters (enforced by a commit
  hook). If you have trouble making that a good summary, add a
  paragraph below it, before the individual file descriptions.

- If only a single file is changed, the summary line can be the normal
  file first line (starting with the asterisk).  Then there is no
  individual files section.

- Explaining the rationale for a design choice is best done in comments
  in the source code. However, sometimes it is useful to describe just
  the rationale for a change; that can be done in the commit message
  between the summary line and the file entries.

** Changelog notes

- Emacs generally follows the GNU coding standards when it comes to
  ChangeLogs:
  http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html .  One
  exception is that we still sometimes quote `like-this' (as the
  standards used to recommend) rather than 'like-this' (as they do
  now), because `...' is so widely used elsewhere in Emacs.

- Some of the rules in the GNU coding standards section 5.2
  "Commenting Your Work" also apply to Changelog entries: they must be
  in English, and be complete sentences starting with a capital and
  ending with a period (except the summary line should not end in a
  period).

  It is tempting to relax this rule for commit messages, since they
  are somewhat transient.  However, they are preserved indefinitely,
  and have a reasonable chance of being read in the future, so it's
  better that they have good presentation.

- There are multiple ChangeLogs in the emacs source; roughly one per
  high-level directory. The ChangeLog entry for a commit belongs in the
  lowest ChangeLog that is higher than or at the same level as any file
  changed by the commit.

- Use the present tense; describe "what the change does", not "what
  the change did".

- Preferred form for several entries with the same content:

   * help.el (view-lossage):
   * kmacro.el (kmacro-edit-lossage):
   * edmacro.el (edit-kbd-macro): Fix docstring, lossage is now 300 keys.

  (Rather than anything involving "ditto" and suchlike.)

- If the commit fixes a bug, add a separate line

  Fixes: bug#NNNN

  where NNNN is the bug number.

- In ChangeLog entries, there is no standard or recommended way to
  identify revisions.

  One way to identify revisions is by quoting their summary line.
  Another is with an action stamp - an RFC3339 date followed by !
  followed by the committer's email - for example,
  "2014-01-16T05:43:35Z!esr@thyrsus.com". Often, "my previous commit"
  will suffice.

- There is no need to make separate ChangeLog entries for files such
  as NEWS, MAINTAINERS, and FOR-RELEASE, or to indicate regeneration
  of files such as 'configure'.  "There is no need" means you don't
  have to, but you can if you want to.

** branches

Development normally takes places on the trunk.
Sometimes specialized features are developed on separate branches
before possibly being merged to the trunk.

Development is discussed on the emacs-devel mailing list.

Sometime before the release of a new major version of Emacs a "feature
freeze" is imposed on the trunk, to prepare for creating a release
branch.  No new features may be added to the trunk after this point,
until the release branch is created. Announcements about the freeze
(and other important events) are made on the info-gnu-emacs mailing
list, and not anywhere else.

The trunk branch is named "master" in git; release branches are named
"emacs-nn" where "nn" is the major version.

If you are fixing a bug that exists in the current release, be sure to
commit it to the release branch; it will be merged to the master
branch later.

However, if you know that the change will be difficult to merge to the
trunk (eg because the trunk code has changed a lot), you can apply the
change to both trunk and branch yourself.  Indicate in the release
branch commit log that there is no need to merge the commit to the
trunk; start the commit message with "Backport:".  gitmerge.el will
then exclude that commit from the merge to trunk.


** Other process information

See all the files in admin/notes/* . In particular, see
admin/notes/newfile, see admin/notes/repo.

*** git vs rename

git does not explicitly represent a file renaming; it uses a percent
changed heuristic to deduce that a file was renamed. So if you are
planning to make extensive changes to a file after renaming it (or
moving it to another directory), you should:

- create a feature branch

- commit the rename without any changes

- make other changes

- merge the feature branch to trunk, _not_ squashing the commits into
  one. The commit message on this merge should summarize the renames
  and all the changes.

** Emacs Mailing lists.

Discussion about Emacs development takes place on emacs-devel@gnu.org.

Bug reports and fixes, feature requests and implementations should be
sent to bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org, the bug/feature list.  This is coupled
to the tracker at http://debbugs.gnu.org .

You can subscribe to the mailing lists, or see the list archives,
by following links from http://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=emacs .

** Document your changes.

Any change that matters to end-users should have an entry in etc/NEWS.

Think about whether your change requires updating the documentation
(both manuals and doc-strings).  If you know it does not, mark the NEWS
entry with "---".  If you know that *all* the necessary documentation
updates have been made, mark the entry with "+++". Otherwise do not mark it.

** Understanding Emacs Internals.

The best way to understand Emacs Internals is to read the code,
but the nodes "Tips" and "GNU Emacs Internals" in the Appendix
of the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual may also help.

The file etc/DEBUG describes how to debug Emacs bugs.
