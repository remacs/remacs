# The '--check' option of git diff-index makes Git complain if changes
# introduce whitespace errors.  This can be a pain when editing test
# files that deliberately contain lines with trailing whitespace.
# To work around the problem you can run a command like 'git config
# core.whitespace -trailing-space'.  It may be better to revamp the
# tests so that trailing spaces are generated on the fly rather than
# being committed as source.
