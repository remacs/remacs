;;; Commentary:

;; Names with "--" are for functions and variables that are meant to be for
;; internal use only.

;; Functional completion tables have an extended calling conventions:
;; The `action' can be (additionally to nil, t, and lambda) of the form
;; - (boundaries . SUFFIX) in which case it should return
;;   (boundaries START . END).  See `completion-boundaries'.
;;   Any other return value should be ignored (so we ignore values returned
;;   from completion tables that don't know about this new `action' form).
;; - `metadata' in which case it should return (metadata . ALIST) where
;;   ALIST is the metadata of this table.  See `completion-metadata'.
;;   Any other return value should be ignored (so we ignore values returned
;;   from completion tables that don't know about this new `action' form).

;;; Bugs:

;; - completion-all-sorted-completions lists all the completions, whereas
;;   it should only lists the ones that `try-completion' would consider.
;;   E.g.  it should honor completion-ignored-extensions.
;; - choose-completion can't automatically figure out the boundaries
;;   corresponding to the displayed completions because we only
;;   provide the start info but not the end info in
;;   completion-base-position.
;; - C-x C-f ~/*/sr ? should not list "~/./src".
;; - minibuffer-force-complete completes ~/src/emacs/t<!>/lisp/minibuffer.el
;;   to ~/src/emacs/trunk/ and throws away lisp/minibuffer.el.

;;; Todo:

;; - Make *Completions* readable even if some of the completion
;;   entries have LF chars or spaces in them (including at
;;   beginning/end) or are very long.
;; - for M-x, cycle-sort commands that have no key binding first.
;; - Make things like icomplete-mode or lightning-completion work with
;;   completion-in-region-mode.
;; - extend `metadata':
;;   - indicate how to turn all-completion's output into
;;     try-completion's output: e.g. completion-ignored-extensions.
;;     maybe that could be merged with the "quote" operation.
;;   - indicate that `all-completions' doesn't do prefix-completion
;;     but just returns some list that relates in some other way to
;;     the provided string (as is the case in filecache.el), in which
;;     case partial-completion (for example) doesn't make any sense
;;     and neither does the completions-first-difference highlight.
;;   - indicate how to display the completions in *Completions* (turn
;;     \n into something else, add special boundaries between
;;     completions).  E.g. when completing from the kill-ring.

;; - case-sensitivity currently confuses two issues:
;;   - whether or not a particular completion table should be case-sensitive
;;     (i.e. whether strings that differ only by case are semantically
;;     equivalent)
;;   - whether the user wants completion to pay attention to case.
;;   e.g. we may want to make it possible for the user to say "first try
;;   completion case-sensitively, and if that fails, try to ignore case".
;;   Maybe the trick is that we should distinguish completion-ignore-case in
;;   try/all-completions (obey user's preference) from its use in
;;   test-completion (obey the underlying object's semantics).

;; - add support for ** to pcm.
;; - Add vc-file-name-completion-table to read-file-name-internal.
;; - A feature like completing-help.el.

initially non-empty, and typing RETURN without editing will fetch the

If this variable is nil, the minibuffer often starts out empty.  In

DEFAULT-FILENAME specifies the default file name to return if the

INITIAL; otherwise, if the current buffer is visiting a file,
that file serves as the default; otherwise, the default is simply
the string inserted into the minibuffer.

string.  (This happens only if the user erases the pre-inserted
contents, or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)

- t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
  the input is (or completes to) an existing file.
- `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
  to confirm her choice if the input is not an existing file.
- `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
  input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
  `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
  and the input is not an existing file.
- anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
  does non-null completion.

Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.

Sixth arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, should be a function of one
argument; then a file name is considered an acceptable completion
alternative only if PREDICATE returns non-nil with the file name
as its argument.

If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a graphical file
dialog if `use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X
toolkit in use provides a file dialog box, and DIR is not a
remote file.  For graphical file dialogs, any of the special values
of MUSTMATCH `confirm' and `confirm-after-completion' are
treated as equivalent to nil.  Some graphical file dialogs respect
a MUSTMATCH value of t, and some do not (or it only has a cosmetic
effect, and does not actually prevent the user from entering a
non-existent file).

See also `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case'
and `read-file-name-function'."
  ;; If x-gtk-use-old-file-dialog = t (xg_get_file_with_selection),
  ;; then MUSTMATCH is enforced.  But with newer Gtk
  ;; (xg_get_file_with_chooser), it only has a cosmetic effect.
