  "This module causes visual commands (e.g., 'vi') to be executed by
the `term' package, which comes with Emacs.  This package handles most
of the ANSI control codes, allowing curses-based applications to run
within an Emacs window.  The variable `eshell-visual-commands' defines
which commands are considered visual in nature."

;;; Commentary:

;; At the moment, eshell is stream-based in its interactive input and
;; output.  This means that full-screen commands, such as "vi" or
;; "lynx", will not display correctly.  These are therefore thought of
;; as "visual" programs.  In order to run these progrem under Emacs,
;; Eshell uses the term.el package, and invokes them in a separate
;; buffer, giving the illusion that Eshell itself is allowing these
;; visual processes to execute.
