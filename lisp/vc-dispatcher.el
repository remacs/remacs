;; Stefan Monnier and Dan Nicolaescu contributed substantial work on the
;; vc-dir front end.

;;; Commentary:

;; Goals:
;;
;; There is a class of front-ending problems that Emacs might be used
;; to address that involves selecting sets of files, or possibly
;; directories, and passing the selection set to slave commands.  The
;; prototypical example, from which this code is derived, is talking
;; to version-control systems. 
;;
;; vc-dispatcher.el is written to decouple the UI issues in such front
;; ends from their application-specific logic. It also provides a
;; service layer for running the slave commands either synchronously
;; or asynchronously and managing the message/error logs from the
;; command runs.
;;
;; Similar UI problems can be expected to come up in applications
;; areas other than VCSes; IDEs and document search are two obvious ones.
;; This mode is intended to ensure that the Emacs interfaces for all such
;; beasts are consistent and carefully designed.  But even if nothing
;; but VC ever uses it, getting the layer separation right will be
;; a valuable thing.

;; Dispatcher's universe:
;;
;; The universe consists of the file tree rooted at the current
;; directory. The dispatcher's upper layer deduces some subset 
;; of the file tree from the state of the currently visited buffer 
;; and returns that subset, presumably to a client mode.
;;
;; The user may be attempting to select one of three contexts: an
;; explicitly selected fileset, the current working directory, or a
;; global (null) context.  The user may be looking at either of two
;; different views; a buffer visiting a file, or a directory buffer
;; generated by vc-dispatcher.  The main UI problem connected with
;; this mode is that the user may need to be able to select any of
;; these three contexts from either view.
;;
;; The lower layer of this mode runs commands in subprocesses, either
;; synchronously or asynchronously.  Commands may be launched in one
;; of two ways: they may be run immediately, or the calling mode can
;; create a closure associated with a text-entry buffer, to be
;; executed when the user types C-c to ship the buffer contents. In
;; either case the command messages and error (if any) will remain
;; available in a status buffer.

;; Special behavior of dispatcher directory buffers:
;;
;; In dispatcher directory buffers, facilities to perform basic
;; navigation and selection operations are provided by keymap and menu
;; entries that dispatcher sets up itself, so they'll be uniform
;; across all dispatcher-using client modes.  Client modes are
;; expected to append to these to provide mode-specific bindings.
;;
;; The standard map associates a 'state' slot (that the client mode
;; may set) with each directory entry.  The dispatcher knows nothing
;; about the semantics of individual states, but mark and unmark commands
;; treat all entries with the same state as the currently selected one as 
;; a unit.

;; The interface
;;
;; The main interface to the lower level is vc-do-command.  This launches a
;; comand, synchronously or asynchronously, making the output available
;; in a command log buffer.  Two other functions, (vc-start-annotation) and
;; (vc-finish-logentry), allow you to associate a command closure with an
;; abbotation buffer so that when the user confirms the comment the closure
;; is run (with the comment as part of its context).
;;
;; The interface to the upper level has the two main entry points (vc-dir)
;; and (vc-dispatcher-selection-set) and a couple of convenience functions.
;; (vc-dir) sets up a dispatcher browsing buffer; (vc-dispatcher-selection-set)
;; returns a selection set of files, either the marked files in a browsing
;; buffer or the singleton set consisting of the file visited by the current
;; buffer (when that is appropriate).  It also does what is needed to ensure 
;; that on-disk files and the contents of their visiting Emacs buffers 
;; coincide.
;;
;; When the client mode adds a local mode-line-hook to a buffer, it
;; will be called with the buffer file name as argument whenever the
;; dispatcher resynchs the buffer.

;; To do:
;;
;; - vc-dir-kill-dir-status-process should not be specific to dir-status,
;;   it should work for other async commands as well (pull/push/...).
;;
;; - the *VC-log* buffer needs font-locking.
;;
;; - Set `vc-dir-insert-directories' to t and check what operations
;;   and backends do not support directory arguments and fix them.
;;
;; - vc-dir needs mouse bindings.
;;
;; - vc-dir needs more key bindings for VC actions.
;;
;; - vc-dir toolbar needs more icons.
;;
;; - vc-dir-next-line should not print an "end of buffer" message when
;;   invoked with the cursor on the last file.
;;
;; - add commands to move to the prev/next directory in vc-dir.
;;
;; - document vc-dir in the manual.
