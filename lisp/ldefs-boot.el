FUNCTION ::= Name of the function to be advised.
CLASS ::= `before' | `around' | `after' | `activation' | `deactivation'.

`activate': All advice of FUNCTION will be activated immediately if

`compile': In conjunction with `activate' specifies that the resulting
advised function should be compiled.

`disable': The defined advice will be disabled, hence, it will not be used
during activation until somebody enables it.

`preactivate': Preactivates the advised FUNCTION at macro-expansion/compile
time.  This generates a compiled advised definition according to the current
advice state that will be used during activation if appropriate.  Only use
this if the `defadvice' gets actually compiled.

Attempt to align a region based on a set of alignment rules.
BEG and END mark the region.  If BEG and END are specifically set to
nil (this can only be done programmatically), the beginning and end of

of point, and the value of `align-region-separate' (or possibly each
rule's `separate' attribute).

If SEPARATE is non-nil, it overrides the value of
`align-region-separate' for all rules, except those that have their
`separate' attribute set.

RULES and EXCLUDE-RULES, if either is non-nil, will replace the
default rule lists defined in `align-rules-list' and

(autoload 'align-regexp "align" "\
Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.
BEG and END mark the limits of the region.  Interactively, this function
prompts for the regular expression REGEXP to align with.

For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to
align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:

    Fred (123) 456-7890
    Alice (123) 456-7890
    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890
    Joe (123) 456-7890

There is no predefined rule to handle this, but you could easily do it
using a REGEXP like \"(\".  Interactively, all you would have to do is
to mark the region, call `align-regexp' and enter that regular expression.

REGEXP must contain at least one parenthesized subexpression, typically
whitespace of the form \"\\\\(\\\\s-*\\\\)\".  In normal interactive use,
this is automatically added to the start of your regular expression after
you enter it.  You only need to supply the characters to be lined up, and
any preceding whitespace is replaced.

If you specify a prefix argument (or use this function non-interactively),
you must enter the full regular expression, including the subexpression.
The function also then prompts for which subexpression parenthesis GROUP
\(default 1) within REGEXP to modify, the amount of SPACING (default
`align-default-spacing') to use, and whether or not to REPEAT the rule
throughout the line.

See `align-rules-list' for more information about these options.

The non-interactive form of the previous example would look something like:
  (align-regexp (point-min) (point-max) \"\\\\(\\\\s-*\\\\)(\")

\\<allout-mode-map-value>
Allout outline mode is a minor mode that provides extensive
outline oriented formatting and manipulation.  It enables
structural editing of outlines, as well as navigation and
exposure.  It also is specifically aimed at accommodating
syntax-sensitive text like programming languages.  (For example,
see the allout code itself, which is organized as an allout
outline.)

In addition to typical outline navigation and exposure, allout includes:

 - topic-oriented authoring, including keystroke-based topic creation,
   repositioning, promotion/demotion, cut, and paste
 - incremental search with dynamic exposure and reconcealment of hidden text
 - adjustable format, so programming code can be developed in outline-structure
 - easy topic encryption and decryption, symmetric or key-pair
 - \"Hot-spot\" operation, for single-keystroke maneuvering and exposure control
 - integral outline layout, for automatic initial exposure when visiting a file
 - independent extensibility, using comprehensive exposure and authoring hooks

and many other features.

Below is a description of the key bindings, and then description
of special `allout-mode' features and terminology.  See also the
outline menubar additions for quick reference to many of the
features.  Customize `allout-auto-activation' to prepare your
Emacs session for automatic activation of `allout-mode'.

The bindings are those listed in `allout-prefixed-keybindings'
and `allout-unprefixed-keybindings'.  We recommend customizing
`allout-command-prefix' to use just `\\C-c' as the command
prefix, if the allout bindings don't conflict with any personal
bindings you have on \\C-c.  In any case, outline structure
navigation and authoring is simplified by positioning the cursor
on an item's bullet character, the \"hot-spot\" -- then you can
invoke allout commands with just the un-prefixed,
un-control-shifted command letters.  This is described further in
the HOT-SPOT Operation section.

        Exposure Control:
        ----------------
\\[allout-hide-current-subtree]   `allout-hide-current-subtree'
\\[allout-show-children] `allout-show-children'

\\[allout-end-of-entry] `allout-end-of-entry'
\\[allout-beginning-of-current-entry] `allout-beginning-of-current-entry' (alternately, goes to hot-spot)
\\[allout-beginning-of-line]  `allout-beginning-of-line' -- like regular beginning-of-line, but
     if immediately repeated cycles to the beginning of the current item
     and then to the hot-spot (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles' is set).


        Topic Header Production:

                  Topic Encryption

Outline mode supports gpg encryption of topics, with support for
symmetric and key-pair modes, and auto-encryption of topics
pending encryption on save.

Topics pending encryption are, by default, automatically
encrypted during file saves, including checkpoint saves, to avoid
exposing the plain text of encrypted topics in the file system.
If the content of the topic containing the cursor was encrypted
for a save, it is automatically decrypted for continued editing.

NOTE: A few GnuPG v2 versions improperly preserve incorrect
symmetric decryption keys, preventing entry of the correct key on
subsequent decryption attempts until the cache times-out.  That
can take several minutes.  (Decryption of other entries is not
affected.)  Upgrade your EasyPG version, if you can, and you can
deliberately clear your gpg-agent's cache by sending it a `-HUP'
signal.

See `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption' function docstring
and `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' customization variable
for details.

                 HOT-SPOT Operation

Hot-spot operation provides a means for easy, single-keystroke outline
navigation and exposure control.

When the text cursor is positioned directly on the bullet character of
a topic, regular characters (a to z) invoke the commands of the
corresponding allout-mode keymap control chars.  For example, \"f\"
would invoke the command typically bound to \"C-c<space>C-f\"
\(\\[allout-forward-current-level] `allout-forward-current-level').

Thus, by positioning the cursor on a topic bullet, you can
execute the outline navigation and manipulation commands with a
single keystroke.  Regular navigation keys (eg, \\[forward-char], \\[next-line]) don't get
this special translation, so you can use them to get out of the
hot-spot and back to normal editing operation.

In allout-mode, the normal beginning-of-line command (\\[allout-beginning-of-line]) is
replaced with one that makes it easy to get to the hot-spot.  If you
repeat it immediately it cycles (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles'
is set) to the beginning of the item and then, if you hit it again
immediately, to the hot-spot.  Similarly, `allout-beginning-of-current-entry'
\(\\[allout-beginning-of-current-entry]) moves to the hot-spot when the cursor is already located
at the beginning of the current entry.

                             Extending Allout

Allout exposure and authoring activities all have associated
hooks, by which independent code can cooperate with allout
without changes to the allout core.  Here are key ones:

`allout-mode-hook'
`allout-mode-deactivate-hook' (deprecated)
`allout-mode-off-hook'
`allout-exposure-change-functions'
`allout-structure-added-functions'
`allout-structure-deleted-functions'
`allout-structure-shifted-functions'
`allout-after-copy-or-kill-hook'
`allout-post-undo-hook'

                            Terminology

Topic hierarchy constituents -- TOPICS and SUBTOPICS:

ITEM:   A unitary outline element, including the HEADER and ENTRY text.
TOPIC:  An ITEM and any ITEMs contained within it, ie having greater DEPTH
        and with no intervening items of lower DEPTH than the container.
CURRENT ITEM:
        The visible ITEM most immediately containing the cursor.
DEPTH:  The degree of nesting of an ITEM; it increases with containment.
        The DEPTH is determined by the HEADER PREFIX.  The DEPTH is also
        called the:
LEVEL:  The same as DEPTH.

ANCESTORS:
        Those ITEMs whose TOPICs contain an ITEM.
PARENT: An ITEM's immediate ANCESTOR.  It has a DEPTH one less than that
        of the ITEM.
OFFSPRING:
        The ITEMs contained within an ITEM's TOPIC.
SUBTOPIC:
        An OFFSPRING of its ANCESTOR TOPICs.
CHILD:
        An immediate SUBTOPIC of its PARENT.
SIBLINGS:
        TOPICs having the same PARENT and DEPTH.

Topic text constituents:

HEADER: The first line of an ITEM, include the ITEM PREFIX and HEADER
        text.
ENTRY:  The text content of an ITEM, before any OFFSPRING, but including
        the HEADER text and distinct from the ITEM PREFIX.
BODY:   Same as ENTRY.
PREFIX: The leading text of an ITEM which distinguishes it from normal
        ENTRY text.  Allout recognizes the outline structure according
        to the strict PREFIX format.  It consists of a PREFIX-LEAD string,
        PREFIX-PADDING, and a BULLET.  The BULLET might be followed by a
        number, indicating the ordinal number of the topic among its
        siblings, or an asterisk indicating encryption, plus an optional
        space.  After that is the ITEM HEADER text, which is not part of
        the PREFIX.

        The relative length of the PREFIX determines the nesting DEPTH
        of the ITEM.
PREFIX-LEAD:
        The string at the beginning of a HEADER PREFIX, by default a `.'.
        It can be customized by changing the setting of
        `allout-header-prefix' and then reinitializing `allout-mode'.

        When the PREFIX-LEAD is set to the comment-string of a
        programming language, outline structuring can be embedded in
        program code without interfering with processing of the text
        (by Emacs or the language processor) as program code.  This
        setting happens automatically when allout mode is used in
        programming-mode buffers.  See `allout-use-mode-specific-leader'
        docstring for more detail.
PREFIX-PADDING:
        Spaces or asterisks which separate the PREFIX-LEAD and the
        bullet, determining the ITEM's DEPTH.
BULLET: A character at the end of the ITEM PREFIX, it must be one of
        the characters listed on `allout-plain-bullets-string' or
        `allout-distinctive-bullets-string'.  When creating a TOPIC,
        plain BULLETs are by default used, according to the DEPTH of the
        TOPIC.  Choice among the distinctive BULLETs is offered when you
        provide a universal argument (\\[universal-argument]) to the
        TOPIC creation command, or when explicitly rebulleting a TOPIC.  The
        significance of the various distinctive bullets is purely by
        convention.  See the documentation for the above bullet strings for
        more details.
EXPOSURE:
        The state of a TOPIC which determines the on-screen visibility
        of its OFFSPRING and contained ENTRY text.
CONCEALED:
        TOPICs and ENTRY text whose EXPOSURE is inhibited.  Concealed
        text is represented by \"...\" ellipses.

        CONCEALED TOPICs are effectively collapsed within an ANCESTOR.
CLOSED: A TOPIC whose immediate OFFSPRING and body-text is CONCEALED.
OPEN:	A TOPIC that is not CLOSED, though its OFFSPRING or BODY may be.

Major mode for editing arrays.

  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.

  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.

  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable `array-respect-tabs' to non-nil will prevent TAB conversion,
but will cause many functions to give errors if they encounter one.

  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local to the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:

Variables you assign:
     array-max-row:          The number of rows in the array.
     array-max-column:       The number of columns in the array.
     array-columns-per-line: The number of columns in the array per line of buffer.
     array-field-width:      The width of each field, in characters.
     array-rows-numbered:    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                       row numbers in the buffer.

Variables which are calculated:
     array-line-length:      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     array-lines-per-row:    The number of buffer lines used to display each row.

  The following commands are available (an asterisk indicates it may
take a numeric prefix argument):

    *  	\\<array-mode-map>\\[array-forward-column]	  Move forward one column.
    *  	\\[array-backward-column]	  Move backward one column.
    *  	\\[array-next-row]	  Move down one row.
    *  	\\[array-previous-row]	  Move up one row.

    *   \\[array-copy-forward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the right.
    *   \\[array-copy-backward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-down]	  Copy the current field into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-up]	  Copy the current field into the row above.

    *   \\[array-copy-column-forward]   Copy the current column into the column to the right.
    *   \\[array-copy-column-backward]   Copy the current column into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-down]   Copy the current row into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-up]   Copy the current row into the row above.

        \\[array-fill-rectangle]   Copy the field at mark into every cell with row and column
                  between that of point and mark.

	\\[array-what-position]	  Display the current array row and column.

Drawing with the mouse:

 mouse-2
 shift mouse-2	Pops up a menu where you can select what to draw with
		mouse-1, and where you can do some settings (described
		below).

 mouse-1
 shift mouse-1	Draws lines, rectangles or poly-lines, erases, cuts, copies
		or pastes:

		* Straight lines can only go horizontally, vertically
		  or diagonally.

		* Poly-lines are drawn while holding mouse-1 down.  When you
		  release the button, the point is set.  If you want a segment
		  to be straight, hold down shift before pressing the
		  mouse-1 button.  Click mouse-2 or mouse-3 to stop drawing
		  poly-lines.

		* See thru for text means that text already in the buffer
		  will be visible through blanks in the text rendered, while
		  overwrite means the opposite.

		* Vaporizing connected lines only vaporizes lines whose
		  _endpoints_ are connected.  See also the variable
		  `artist-vaporize-fuzziness'.

		* Cut copies, then clears the rectangle/square.

		* When drawing lines or poly-lines, you can set arrows.
		  See below under \"Arrows\" for more info.

		* The mode line shows the currently selected drawing operation.
		  In addition, if it has an asterisk (*) at the end, you
		  are currently drawing something.

		* Be patient when flood-filling -- large areas take quite
		  some time to fill.


 mouse-3	Erases character under pointer

In Autoarg mode, digits are bound to `digit-argument', i.e. they
supply prefix arguments as C-DIGIT and M-DIGIT normally do.
Furthermore, C-DIGIT inserts DIGIT.
\\[autoarg-terminate] terminates the prefix sequence and inserts
the digits of the autoarg sequence into the buffer.
Without a numeric prefix arg, the normal binding of \\[autoarg-terminate]
is invoked, i.e. what it would be with Autoarg mode off.

For example:
`6 9 \\[autoarg-terminate]' inserts `69' into the buffer, as does `C-6 C-9'.
`6 9 a' inserts 69 `a's into the buffer.
`6 9 \\[autoarg-terminate] \\[autoarg-terminate]' inserts `69' into the buffer and
then invokes the normal binding of \\[autoarg-terminate].

to field.  After having filled in all desired fields in the entry, clean the
new entry with the command \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting the variable
`bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries' to non-nil.  However, then BibTeX mode
works only with buffers containing valid (syntactically correct) and sorted
entries.  This is usually the case, if you have created a buffer completely
with BibTeX mode and finished every new entry with \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

For third party BibTeX files, call the command \\[bibtex-convert-alien]
to fully take advantage of all features of BibTeX mode.


Special information:

A command such as \\[bibtex-Book] outlines the fields for a BibTeX book entry.

The names of optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored
by BibTeX.  The names of alternative fields from which only one is required
start with the string ALT.  The OPT or ALT string may be removed from
the name of a field with \\[bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT].
\\[bibtex-make-field] inserts a new field after the current one.
\\[bibtex-kill-field] kills the current field entirely.
\\[bibtex-yank] yanks the last recently killed field after the current field.
\\[bibtex-remove-delimiters] removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
\\[bibtex-empty-field] replaces the text of the current field with the default \"\" or {}.
\\[bibtex-find-text] moves point to the end of the current field.
\\[completion-at-point] completes word fragment before point according to context.

The command \\[bibtex-clean-entry] cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from the names of all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that
no required fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value
of `bibtex-entry-format'.  Furthermore, it can automatically generate a key
for the BibTeX entry, see `bibtex-generate-autokey'.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from `bibtex-entry-format'.

BibTeX mode supports Imenu and hideshow minor mode (`hs-minor-mode').

Play blackbox.
Optional prefix argument is the number of balls; the default is 4.

What is blackbox?

Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.

Overview of play:

\\<blackbox-mode-map>To play blackbox, type \\[blackbox].  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.

The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.

To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.

You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing \\[bb-romp].

When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press \\[bb-done].  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.

Details:

There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:

	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.

	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.

	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.

The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.

As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under \"Detour\" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.

Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.

                                2                         3

As mentioned above, a reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point
it was sent in.  This can happen in several ways:


  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -
R * * * * - - - -         - - - * - - - -          O - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.

A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -        H * * * * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       H * * * * O - - -          - - - * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - O - - - -
H * * * O - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -

Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection.

Display a three-month Gregorian calendar.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in
the middle surrounded by the previous and next months.  The
cursor is put on today's date.  If optional prefix argument ARG
is non-nil, prompts for the central month and year.

Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved
into view.  Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar
can be scrolled forward or backward.  The cursor can be moved
forward or backward by one day, one week, one month, or one year.
All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the
digit keys and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  Use
\\[describe-mode] for details of the key bindings in the calendar
window.

Displays the calendar in a separate window, or optionally in a
separate frame, depending on the value of `calendar-setup'.

If `calendar-view-diary-initially-flag' is non-nil, also displays the
diary entries for the current date (or however many days
`diary-number-of-entries' specifies).  This variable can be
overridden by `calendar-setup'.  As well as being displayed,
diary entries can also be marked on the calendar (see
`calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag').

Runs the following hooks:

`calendar-today-visible-hook', `calendar-today-invisible-hook' - after
   generating a calendar, if today's date is visible or not, respectively
`calendar-initial-window-hook' - after first creating a calendar

STYLENAME, a string, must be an existing CC Mode style - These are contained

The variable `c-indentation-style' will get set to STYLENAME.

\"Setting the style\" is done by setting CC Mode's \"style variables\" to the
values indicated by the pertinent entry in `c-style-alist'.  Other variables
might get set too.

If DONT-OVERRIDE is neither nil nor t, style variables whose default values
have been set (more precisely, whose default values are not the symbol
`set-from-style') will not be changed.  This avoids overriding global settings
done in your init file.  It is useful to call c-set-style from a mode hook
in this way.

If DONT-OVERRIDE is t, style variables that already have values (i.e., whose
values are not the symbol `set-from-style') will not be overridden.  CC Mode
calls c-set-style internally in this way whilst initializing a buffer; if

CCL-PROGRAM has this form:

BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION is an integer value specifying the approximate
output buffer magnification size compared with the bytes of input data
text.  It is assured that the actual output buffer has 256 bytes
more than the size calculated by BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION.
If the value is zero, the CCL program can't execute `read' and
`write' commands.

CCL_MAIN_CODE and CCL_EOF_CODE are CCL program codes.  CCL_MAIN_CODE
executed at first.  If there's no more input data when `read' command
is executed in CCL_MAIN_CODE, CCL_EOF_CODE is executed.  If
CCL_MAIN_CODE is terminated, CCL_EOF_CODE is not executed.

(autoload 'common-lisp-indent-function "cl-indent" "\
Function to indent the arguments of a Lisp function call.
This is suitable for use as the value of the variable
`lisp-indent-function'.  INDENT-POINT is the point at which the
indentation function is called, and STATE is the
`parse-partial-sexp' state at that position.  Browse the
`lisp-indent' customize group for options affecting the behavior
of this function.

If the indentation point is in a call to a Lisp function, that
function's `common-lisp-indent-function' property specifies how
this function should indent it.  Possible values for this
property are:

* defun, meaning indent according to `lisp-indent-defun-method';
  i.e., like (4 &lambda &body), as explained below.

* any other symbol, meaning a function to call.  The function should
  take the arguments: PATH STATE INDENT-POINT SEXP-COLUMN NORMAL-INDENT.
  PATH is a list of integers describing the position of point in terms of
  list-structure with respect to the containing lists.  For example, in
  ((a b c (d foo) f) g), foo has a path of (0 3 1).  In other words,
  to reach foo take the 0th element of the outermost list, then
  the 3rd element of the next list, and finally the 1st element.
  STATE and INDENT-POINT are as in the arguments to
  `common-lisp-indent-function'.  SEXP-COLUMN is the column of
  the open parenthesis of the innermost containing list.
  NORMAL-INDENT is the column the indentation point was
  originally in.  This function should behave like `lisp-indent-259'.

* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments like
  function arguments, and any further arguments like a body.
  This is equivalent to (4 4 ... &body).

* a list.  The list element in position M specifies how to indent the Mth
  function argument.  If there are fewer elements than function arguments,
  the last list element applies to all remaining arguments.  The accepted
  list elements are:

  * nil, meaning the default indentation.

  * an integer, specifying an explicit indentation.

  * &lambda.  Indent the argument (which may be a list) by 4.

  * &rest.  When used, this must be the penultimate element.  The
    element after this one applies to all remaining arguments.

  * &body.  This is equivalent to &rest lisp-body-indent, i.e., indent
    all remaining elements by `lisp-body-indent'.

  * &whole.  This must be followed by nil, an integer, or a
    function symbol.  This indentation is applied to the
    associated argument, and as a base indent for all remaining
    arguments.  For example, an integer P means indent this
    argument by P, and all remaining arguments by P, plus the
    value specified by their associated list element.

  * a symbol.  A function to call, with the 6 arguments specified above.

  * a list, with elements as described above.  This applies when the
    associated function argument is itself a list.  Each element of the list
    specifies how to indent the associated argument.

For example, the function `case' has an indent property
\(4 &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1)), meaning:
  * indent the first argument by 4.
  * arguments after the first should be lists, and there may be any number
    of them.  The first list element has an offset of 2, all the rest
    have an offset of 2+1=3.

If the current mode is actually `emacs-lisp-mode', look for a
`common-lisp-indent-function-for-elisp' property before looking
at `common-lisp-indent-function' and, if set, use its value
instead.

Mode for Unix and Windows Conf files and Java properties.
Most conf files know only three kinds of constructs: parameter
assignments optionally grouped into sections and comments.  Yet
there is a great range of variation in the exact syntax of conf
files.  See below for various wrapper commands that set up the
details for some of the most widespread variants.

This mode sets up font locking, outline, imenu and it provides
alignment support through `conf-align-assignments'.  If strings
come out wrong, try `conf-quote-normal'.

Some files allow continuation lines, either with a backslash at
the end of line, or by indenting the next line (further).  These
constructs cannot currently be recognized.

Because of this great variety of nuances, which are often not
even clearly specified, please don't expect it to get every file
quite right.  Patches that clearly identify some special case,
without breaking the general ones, are welcome.

If instead you start this mode with the generic `conf-mode'
command, it will parse the buffer.  It will generally well
identify the first four cases listed below.  If the buffer
doesn't have enough contents to decide, this is identical to
`conf-windows-mode' on Windows, elsewhere to `conf-unix-mode'.
See also `conf-space-mode', `conf-colon-mode', `conf-javaprop-mode',

Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Various characters in Perl almost always come in pairs: {}, (), [],
sometimes <>.  When the user types the first, she gets the second as
well, with optional special formatting done on {}.  (Disabled by
default.)  You can always quote (with \\[quoted-insert]) the left
\"paren\" to avoid the expansion.  The processing of < is special,
since most the time you mean \"less\".  CPerl mode tries to guess
whether you want to type pair <>, and inserts is if it
appropriate.  You can set `cperl-electric-parens-string' to the string that
contains the parens from the above list you want to be electrical.
Electricity of parens is controlled by `cperl-electric-parens'.
You may also set `cperl-electric-parens-mark' to have electric parens
look for active mark and \"embrace\" a region if possible.'

CPerl mode provides expansion of the Perl control constructs:

   if, else, elsif, unless, while, until, continue, do,
   for, foreach, formy and foreachmy.

and POD directives (Disabled by default, see `cperl-electric-keywords'.)

The user types the keyword immediately followed by a space, which
causes the construct to be expanded, and the point is positioned where
she is most likely to want to be.  E.g., when the user types a space
following \"if\" the following appears in the buffer: if () { or if ()
} { } and the cursor is between the parentheses.  The user can then
type some boolean expression within the parens.  Having done that,
typing \\[cperl-linefeed] places you - appropriately indented - on a
new line between the braces (if you typed \\[cperl-linefeed] in a POD
directive line, then appropriate number of new lines is inserted).

If CPerl decides that you want to insert \"English\" style construct like

            bite if angry;

it will not do any expansion.  See also help on variable
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'.  (Note that one can switch the
help message on expansion by setting `cperl-message-electric-keyword'
to nil.)

\\[cperl-linefeed] is a convenience replacement for typing carriage
return.  It places you in the next line with proper indentation, or if
you type it inside the inline block of control construct, like

            foreach (@lines) {print; print}

and you are on a boundary of a statement inside braces, it will
transform the construct into a multiline and will place you into an
appropriately indented blank line.  If you need a usual
`newline-and-indent' behavior, it is on \\[newline-and-indent],
see documentation on `cperl-electric-linefeed'.

Use \\[cperl-invert-if-unless] to change a construction of the form

	    if (A) { B }

into

            B if A;

\\{cperl-mode-map}

Setting the variable `cperl-font-lock' to t switches on font-lock-mode
\(even with older Emacsen), `cperl-electric-lbrace-space' to t switches
on electric space between $ and {, `cperl-electric-parens-string' is
the string that contains parentheses that should be electric in CPerl
\(see also `cperl-electric-parens-mark' and `cperl-electric-parens'),
setting `cperl-electric-keywords' enables electric expansion of
control structures in CPerl.  `cperl-electric-linefeed' governs which
one of two linefeed behavior is preferable.  You can enable all these
options simultaneously (recommended mode of use) by setting
`cperl-hairy' to t.  In this case you can switch separate options off
by setting them to `null'.  Note that one may undo the extra
whitespace inserted by semis and braces in `auto-newline'-mode by
consequent \\[cperl-electric-backspace].

If your site has perl5 documentation in info format, you can use commands
\\[cperl-info-on-current-command] and \\[cperl-info-on-command] to access it.
These keys run commands `cperl-info-on-current-command' and
`cperl-info-on-command', which one is which is controlled by variable
`cperl-info-on-command-no-prompt' and `cperl-clobber-lisp-bindings'
\(in turn affected by `cperl-hairy').

Even if you have no info-format documentation, short one-liner-style
help is available on \\[cperl-get-help], and one can run perldoc or
man via menu.

It is possible to show this help automatically after some idle time.
This is regulated by variable `cperl-lazy-help-time'.  Default with
`cperl-hairy' (if the value of `cperl-lazy-help-time' is nil) is 5
secs idle time .  It is also possible to switch this on/off from the
menu, or via \\[cperl-toggle-autohelp].

Use \\[cperl-lineup] to vertically lineup some construction - put the
beginning of the region at the start of construction, and make region
span the needed amount of lines.

Variables `cperl-pod-here-scan', `cperl-pod-here-fontify',
`cperl-pod-face', `cperl-pod-head-face' control processing of POD and
here-docs sections.  With capable Emaxen results of scan are used
for indentation too, otherwise they are used for highlighting only.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `cperl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in CPerl mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `cperl-indent-left-aligned-comments'
    Non-nil means that the comment starting in leftmost column should indent.
 `cperl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in Perl code.  The following
    \\[cperl-electric-backspace] will remove the inserted whitespace.
    Insertion after colons requires both this variable and
    `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon' set.
 `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon'
    Non-nil means automatically newline even after colons.
    Subject to `cperl-auto-newline' setting.
 `cperl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `cperl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if, or body of a while, or just a statement continuation.
 `cperl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `cperl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `cperl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `cperl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it the line started
    this far to the right of the actual line indentation.
 `cperl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `cperl-min-label-indent'
    Minimal indentation for line that is a label.

Settings for classic indent-styles: K&R BSD=C++ GNU PerlStyle=Whitesmith
  `cperl-indent-level'                5   4       2   4
  `cperl-brace-offset'                0   0       0   0

  `cperl-continued-statement-offset'  5   4       2   4

CPerl knows several indentation styles, and may bulk set the
corresponding variables.  Use \\[cperl-set-style] to do this.  Use
\\[cperl-set-style-back] to restore the memorized preexisting values
\(both available from menu).  See examples in `cperl-style-examples'.

Part of the indentation style is how different parts of if/elsif/else
statements are broken into lines; in CPerl, this is reflected on how
templates for these constructs are created (controlled by
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'), and how reflow-logic should treat
\"continuation\" blocks of else/elsif/continue, controlled by the same
variable, and by `cperl-extra-newline-before-brace-multiline',
`cperl-merge-trailing-else', `cperl-indent-region-fix-constructs'.

If `cperl-indent-level' is 0, the statement after opening brace in
column 0 is indented on
`cperl-brace-offset'+`cperl-continued-statement-offset'.

Turning on CPerl mode calls the hooks in the variable `cperl-mode-hook'
with no args.

DO NOT FORGET to read micro-docs (available from `Perl' menu)

Alist mapping versions of a package to Emacs versions.
We use this for packages that have their own names, but are released

Each elements looks like this:

     (PACKAGE (PVERSION . EVERSION)...)

Here PACKAGE is the name of a package, as a symbol.  After
PACKAGE come one or more elements, each associating a
package version PVERSION with the first Emacs version
EVERSION in which it (or a subsequent version of PACKAGE)
was first released.  Both PVERSION and EVERSION are strings.
PVERSION should be a string that this package used in
the :package-version keyword for `defcustom', `defgroup',
and `defface'.

For example, the MH-E package updates this alist as follows:

     (add-to-list \\='customize-package-emacs-version-alist
                  \\='(MH-E (\"6.0\" . \"22.1\") (\"6.1\" . \"22.1\")

                         (\"7.4\" . \"22.1\") (\"8.0\" . \"22.1\")))

The value of PACKAGE needs to be unique and it needs to match the
PACKAGE value appearing in the :package-version keyword.  Since
the user might see the value in an error message, a good choice is
the official name of the package, such as MH-E or Gnus.")

This will preserve your existing customizations.

If you save this option using Custom, Custom will write all

`custom-set-variables' and `custom-set-faces' forms already

 dcl-imenu-label-labels
 dcl-imenu-label-goto
 dcl-imenu-label-gosub

Create a new mode as a variant of an existing mode.

The arguments to this command are as follow:

CHILD:     the name of the command for the derived mode.
PARENT:    the name of the command for the parent mode (e.g. `text-mode')
           or nil if there is no parent.
NAME:      a string which will appear in the status line (e.g. \"Hypertext\")
DOCSTRING: an optional documentation string--if you do not supply one,
           the function will attempt to invent something useful.
BODY:      forms to execute just before running the
           hooks for the new mode.  Do not use `interactive' here.

BODY can start with a bunch of keyword arguments.  The following keyword
  arguments are currently understood:
:group GROUP
	Declare the customization group that corresponds to this mode.
	The command `customize-mode' uses this.
:syntax-table TABLE
	Use TABLE instead of the default (CHILD-syntax-table).
	A nil value means to simply use the same syntax-table as the parent.
:abbrev-table TABLE
	Use TABLE instead of the default (CHILD-abbrev-table).
	A nil value means to simply use the same abbrev-table as the parent.
:after-hook FORM
	A single lisp form which is evaluated after the mode hooks have been
	run.  It should not be quoted.

Here is how you could define LaTeX-Thesis mode as a variant of LaTeX mode:

  (define-derived-mode LaTeX-thesis-mode LaTeX-mode \"LaTeX-Thesis\")

You could then make new key bindings for `LaTeX-thesis-mode-map'
without changing regular LaTeX mode.  In this example, BODY is empty,
and DOCSTRING is generated by default.

On a more complicated level, the following command uses `sgml-mode' as
the parent, and then sets the variable `case-fold-search' to nil:

  (define-derived-mode article-mode sgml-mode \"Article\"
    \"Major mode for editing technical articles.\"
    (setq case-fold-search nil))

Note that if the documentation string had been left out, it would have
been generated automatically, with a reference to the keymap.

`derived-mode-hook-name'.

Define a new minor mode MODE.
This defines the toggle command MODE and (by default) a control variable
MODE (you can override this with the :variable keyword, see below).
DOC is the documentation for the mode toggle command.

The defined mode command takes one optional (prefix) argument.
Interactively with no prefix argument, it toggles the mode.
A prefix argument enables the mode if the argument is positive,
and disables it otherwise.

When called from Lisp, the mode command toggles the mode if the
argument is `toggle', disables the mode if the argument is a
non-positive integer, and enables the mode otherwise (including
if the argument is omitted or nil or a positive integer).

If DOC is nil, give the mode command a basic doc-string
documenting what its argument does.

Optional INIT-VALUE is the initial value of the mode's variable.
Optional LIGHTER is displayed in the mode line when the mode is on.
Optional KEYMAP is the default keymap bound to the mode keymap.
  If non-nil, it should be a variable name (whose value is a keymap),
  or an expression that returns either a keymap or a list of
  (KEY . BINDING) pairs where KEY and BINDING are suitable for
  `define-key'.  If you supply a KEYMAP argument that is not a
  symbol, this macro defines the variable MODE-map and gives it
  the value that KEYMAP specifies.

BODY contains code to execute each time the mode is enabled or disabled.
  It is executed after toggling the mode, and before running MODE-hook.
  Before the actual body code, you can write keyword arguments, i.e.
  alternating keywords and values.  If you provide BODY, then you must
  provide (even if just nil) INIT-VALUE, LIGHTER, and KEYMAP, or provide
  at least one keyword argument, or both; otherwise, BODY would be
  misinterpreted as the first omitted argument.  The following special
  keywords are supported (other keywords are passed to `defcustom' if
  the minor mode is global):

:group GROUP	Custom group name to use in all generated `defcustom' forms.
		Defaults to MODE without the possible trailing \"-mode\".
		Don't use this default group name unless you have written a
		`defgroup' to define that group properly.
:global GLOBAL	If non-nil specifies that the minor mode is not meant to be
		buffer-local, so don't make the variable MODE buffer-local.
		By default, the mode is buffer-local.
:init-value VAL	Same as the INIT-VALUE argument.
		Not used if you also specify :variable.
:lighter SPEC	Same as the LIGHTER argument.
:keymap MAP	Same as the KEYMAP argument.
:require SYM	Same as in `defcustom'.
:variable PLACE	The location to use instead of the variable MODE to store
		the state of the mode.	This can be simply a different
		named variable, or a generalized variable.
		PLACE can also be of the form (GET . SET), where GET is
		an expression that returns the current state, and SET is
		a function that takes one argument, the new state, and
		sets it.  If you specify a :variable, this function does
		not define a MODE variable (nor any of the terms used
		in :variable).

:after-hook     A single lisp form which is evaluated after the mode hooks
                have been run.  It should not be quoted.

For example, you could write
  (define-minor-mode foo-mode \"If enabled, foo on you!\"
    :lighter \" Foo\" :require \\='foo :global t :group \\='hassle :version \"27.5\"
    ...BODY CODE...)

KEYS is a list of CL-style keyword arguments.  As the minor mode
  defined by this function is always global, any :global keyword is

  The most useful keywords are those that are passed on to the

prevent problems with derived modes, that is, major modes that

MAPS, if non-nil, should be a keymap or a list of keymaps; add
the submenu defined by MENU to the keymap or each of the keymaps,
as a top-level menu bar item.

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar
item name.  It may be followed by the following keyword argument
pairs:

 :filter FUNCTION
    FUNCTION must be a function which, if called with one
    argument---the list of the other menu items---returns the
    items to actually display.

 :visible INCLUDE
    INCLUDE is an expression.  The menu is visible if the
    expression evaluates to a non-nil value.  `:included' is an
    alias for `:visible'.

 :active ENABLE
    ENABLE is an expression.  The menu is enabled for selection
    if the expression evaluates to a non-nil value.  `:enable' is
    an alias for `:active'.

The rest of the elements in MENU are menu items.
A menu item can be a vector of three elements:

  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen, or an
expression to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection if the
expression evaluates to a non-nil value.

Alternatively, a menu item may have the form:

   [ NAME CALLBACK [ KEYWORD ARG ]... ]

where NAME and CALLBACK have the same meanings as above, and each
optional KEYWORD and ARG pair should be one of the following:

 :keys KEYS
    KEYS is a string; a keyboard equivalent to the menu item.
    This is normally not needed because keyboard equivalents are
    usually computed automatically.  KEYS is expanded with
    `substitute-command-keys' before it is used.

 :key-sequence KEYS
    KEYS is a hint for speeding up Emacs's first display of the
    menu.  It should be nil if you know that the menu item has no
    keyboard equivalent; otherwise it should be a string or
    vector specifying a keyboard equivalent for the menu item.

 :active ENABLE
    ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
    whenever this expression's value is non-nil.  `:enable' is an
    alias for `:active'.

 :visible INCLUDE
    INCLUDE is an expression; this item is only visible if this
    expression has a non-nil value.  `:included' is an alias for
    `:visible'.

 :label FORM
    FORM is an expression that is dynamically evaluated and whose
    value serves as the menu item's label (the default is NAME).

 :suffix FORM
    FORM is an expression that is dynamically evaluated and whose
    value is concatenated with the menu entry's label.

 :style STYLE
    STYLE is a symbol describing the type of menu item; it should
    be `toggle' (a checkbox), or `radio' (a radio button), or any
    other value (meaning an ordinary menu item).

 :selected SELECTED
    SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is
    selected whenever the expression's value is non-nil.

 :help HELP
    HELP is a string, the help to display for the menu item.

Alternatively, a menu item can be a string.  Then that string
appears in the menu as unselectable text.  A string consisting
solely of dashes is displayed as a menu separator.

Alternatively, a menu item can be a list with the same format as
MENU.  This is a submenu.

Pop up an \"electric\" help buffer.
THUNK is a function of no arguments which is called to initialize the
contents of BUFFER.  BUFFER defaults to `*Help*'.  BUFFER will be
erased before THUNK is called unless NOERASE is non-nil.  THUNK will
be called while BUFFER is current and with `standard-output' bound to
the buffer specified by BUFFER.

If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and shrink
the window to fit.  If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.

After THUNK has been called, this function \"electrically\" pops up a
window in which BUFFER is displayed and allows the user to scroll
through that buffer in `electric-help-mode'.  The window's height will
be at least MINHEIGHT if this value is non-nil.

If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and
shrink the window to fit if `electric-help-shrink-window' is non-nil.
If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.

When the user exits (with `electric-help-exit', or otherwise), the help
buffer's window disappears (i.e., we use `save-window-excursion'), and
BUFFER is put back into its original major mode.

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.  The
customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' and
`flymake-start-syntax-check-on-newline' determine the exact
circumstances whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of
the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
in the variable `flymake-diagnostic-types-alist'.

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer. The commands
`flymake-running-backends', `flymake-disabled-backends' and
`flymake-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the

Flyspell mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When enabled, it

flyspell behavior is to highlight incorrect words.

Bindings:

Hooks:

Remark:
`flyspell-mode' uses `ispell-mode'.  Thus all Ispell options are
valid.  For instance, a different dictionary can be used by
invoking `ispell-change-dictionary'.

Consider using the `ispell-parser' to check your text.  For instance
consider adding:
\(add-hook \\='tex-mode-hook (function (lambda () (setq ispell-parser \\='tex))))

Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)

* Should point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two or
more side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of
Follow mode, use these full-height windows as though they were one.
Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text, and
being able to use 144 or 216 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\\[split-window-right]' or `\\[follow-delete-other-windows-and-split]' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.

This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.

Keys specific to Follow mode:

Alist of frame parameters and filtering functions.

This alist is the default value of the FILTERS argument of
`frameset-save' and `frameset-restore' (which see).

Initially, `frameset-filter-alist' is set to, and shares the value of,
`frameset-persistent-filter-alist'.  You can override any item in
this alist by `push'ing a new item onto it.  If, for some reason, you
intend to modify existing values, do

  (setq frameset-filter-alist (copy-tree frameset-filter-alist))

before changing anything.

On saving, PARAMETERS is the parameter alist of each frame processed,
and FILTERED is the parameter alist that gets saved to the frameset.

On restoring, PARAMETERS is the parameter alist extracted from the
frameset, and FILTERED is the resulting frame parameter alist used
to restore the frame.

Elements of `frameset-filter-alist' are conses (PARAM . ACTION),
where PARAM is a parameter name (a symbol identifying a frame
parameter), and ACTION can be:

 nil       The parameter is copied to FILTERED.
 :never    The parameter is never copied to FILTERED.
 :save     The parameter is copied only when saving the frame.
 :restore  The parameter is copied only when restoring the frame.
 FILTER    A filter function.

FILTER can be a symbol FILTER-FUN, or a list (FILTER-FUN ARGS...).
FILTER-FUN is invoked with

  (apply FILTER-FUN CURRENT FILTERED PARAMETERS SAVING ARGS)

where

 CURRENT     A cons (PARAM . VALUE), where PARAM is the one being
	     filtered and VALUE is its current value.
 FILTERED    The resulting alist (so far).
 PARAMETERS  The complete alist of parameters being filtered,
 SAVING      Non-nil if filtering before saving state, nil if filtering
	       before restoring it.
 ARGS        Any additional arguments specified in the ACTION.

FILTER-FUN is allowed to modify items in FILTERED, but no other arguments.
It must return:
 nil                      Skip CURRENT (do not add it to FILTERED).
 t                        Add CURRENT to FILTERED as is.

Restore a FRAMESET into the current display(s).

PREDICATE is a function called with two arguments, the parameter alist
and the window-state of the frame being restored, in that order (see
the docstring of the `frameset' defstruct for additional details).
If PREDICATE returns nil, the frame described by that parameter alist
and window-state is not restored.

FILTERS is an alist of parameter filters; if nil, the value of
`frameset-filter-alist' is used instead.

REUSE-FRAMES selects the policy to reuse frames when restoring:
  t        All existing frames can be reused.
  nil      No existing frame can be reused.
  match    Only frames with matching frame ids can be reused.
  PRED     A predicate function; it receives as argument a live frame,
             and must return non-nil to allow reusing it, nil otherwise.

FORCE-DISPLAY can be:
  t        Frames are restored in the current display.
  nil      Frames are restored, if possible, in their original displays.
  delete   Frames in other displays are deleted instead of restored.
  PRED     A function called with two arguments, the parameter alist and
	     the window state (in that order).  It must return t, nil or
	     `delete', as above but affecting only the frame that will
	     be created from that parameter alist.

FORCE-ONSCREEN can be:
  t        Force onscreen only those frames that are fully offscreen.
  nil      Do not force any frame back onscreen.
  all      Force onscreen any frame fully or partially offscreen.
  PRED     A function called with three arguments,
	   - the live frame just restored,
	   - a list (LEFT TOP WIDTH HEIGHT), describing the frame,
	   - a list (LEFT TOP WIDTH HEIGHT), describing the workarea.
	   It must return non-nil to force the frame onscreen, nil otherwise.

CLEANUP-FRAMES allows \"cleaning up\" the frame list after restoring a frameset:
  t        Delete all frames that were not created or restored upon.
  nil      Keep all frames.
  FUNC     A function called with two arguments:
           - FRAME, a live frame.
           - ACTION, which can be one of
             :rejected  Frame existed, but was not a candidate for reuse.
             :ignored   Frame existed, was a candidate, but wasn't reused.
             :reused    Frame existed, was a candidate, and restored upon.
             :created   Frame didn't exist, was created and restored upon.
           Return value is ignored.

Note the timing and scope of the operations described above: REUSE-FRAMES
affects existing frames; PREDICATE, FILTERS and FORCE-DISPLAY affect the frame
being restored before that happens; FORCE-ONSCREEN affects the frame once
it has been restored; and CLEANUP-FRAMES affects all frames alive after the
restoration, including those that have been reused or created anew.

If option `gdb-many-windows' is t, regardless of the value of

`gdb-many-windows'    - Toggle the number of windows gdb uses.
`gdb-restore-windows' - To restore the window layout.

existing groups are considered.

if NO-CROSSPOST is omitted or nil, a & split will be returned,
otherwise, a | split, that does not allow crossposting, will be

For each selected group, a SPLIT is composed like this: if SPLIT-SPEC
is specified, this split is returned as-is (unless it is nil: in this
case, the group is ignored).  Otherwise, if TO-ADDRESS, TO-LIST and/or
EXTRA-ALIASES are specified, a regexp that matches any of them is
constructed (extra-aliases may be a list).  Additionally, if
SPLIT-REGEXP is specified, the regexp will be extended so that it
matches this regexp too, and if SPLIT-EXCLUDE is specified, RESTRICT
clauses will be generated.

If CATCH-ALL is nil, no catch-all handling is performed, regardless of
catch-all marks in group parameters.  Otherwise, if there is no
selected group whose SPLIT-REGEXP matches the empty string, nor is
there a selected group whose SPLIT-SPEC is `catch-all', this fancy
split (say, a group name) will be appended to the returned SPLIT list,

nnml:mail.bar:

nnml:mail.foo:
\((to-list . \"foo@nowhere.gov\")

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal Emacs text buffer.
Most cursor movement bindings are the same: use \\[hexl-backward-char], \\[hexl-forward-char], \\[hexl-next-line], and \\[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up.

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \\[hexl-beginning-of-line], \\[hexl-end-of-line], \\[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \\[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.

\\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit `hexl-mode'.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \\[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in Hexl mode.

Toggle selective highlighting of patterns (Hi Lock mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hi Lock mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

Hi Lock mode is automatically enabled when you invoke any of the
highlighting commands listed below, such as \\[highlight-regexp].
To enable Hi Lock mode in all buffers, use `global-hi-lock-mode'
or add (global-hi-lock-mode 1) to your init file.

In buffers where Font Lock mode is enabled, patterns are
highlighted using font lock.  In buffers where Font Lock mode is
disabled, patterns are applied using overlays; in this case, the
highlighting will not be updated as you type.

When Hi Lock mode is enabled, a \"Regexp Highlighting\" submenu
is added to the \"Edit\" menu.  The commands in the submenu,
which can be called interactively, are:

\\[highlight-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\\[highlight-phrase] PHRASE FACE
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)

\\[highlight-lines-matching-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\\[highlight-symbol-at-point]
  Highlight the symbol found near point without prompting, using the next
  available face automatically.

\\[unhighlight-regexp] REGEXP
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.

\\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible).  They may
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the \\[hi-lock-find-patterns] command
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.
  (See `font-lock-keywords'.)  They may be edited and re-loaded with \\[hi-lock-find-patterns],
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.  When a file is
  loaded the patterns are read if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is
  `ask' and the user responds y to the prompt, or if
  `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is bound to a function and that
  function returns t.

\\[hi-lock-find-patterns]
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by \\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]).

When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded or patterns
rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the
form:

With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hide-Ifdef mode if ARG is

the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

Hide-Ifdef mode is a buffer-local minor mode for use with C and
C-like major modes.  When enabled, code within #ifdef constructs
that the C preprocessor would eliminate may be hidden from view.
Several variables affect how the hiding is done:

`hide-ifdef-env'
        An association list of defined and undefined symbols for the
        current project.  Initially, the global value of `hide-ifdef-env'
        is used.  This variable was a buffer-local variable, which limits
        hideif to parse only one C/C++ file at a time.  We've extended
        hideif to support parsing a C/C++ project containing multiple C/C++
        source files opened simultaneously in different buffers.  Therefore
        `hide-ifdef-env' can no longer be buffer local but must be global.

`hide-ifdef-define-alist'
        An association list of defined symbol lists.
        Use `hide-ifdef-set-define-alist' to save the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        and `hide-ifdef-use-define-alist' to set the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        from one of the lists in `hide-ifdef-define-alist'.

`hide-ifdef-lines'
        Set to non-nil to not show #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and
        #endif lines when hiding.

`hide-ifdef-initially'
        Indicates whether `hide-ifdefs' should be called when Hide-Ifdef mode
        is activated.

`hide-ifdef-read-only'
        Set to non-nil if you want to make buffers read only while hiding.
        After `show-ifdefs', read-only status is restored to previous value.

Each element has the form
  (MODE START END COMMENT-START FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC ADJUST-BEG-FUNC).

If non-nil, hideshow will use these values as regexps to define blocks
and comments, respectively for major mode MODE.

START, END and COMMENT-START are regular expressions.  A block is
defined as text surrounded by START and END.

As a special case, START may be a list of the form (COMPLEX-START
MDATA-SELECTOR), where COMPLEX-START is a regexp w/ multiple parts and
MDATA-SELECTOR an integer that specifies which sub-match is the proper
place to adjust point, before calling `hs-forward-sexp-func'.  Point
is adjusted to the beginning of the specified match.  For example,
see the `hs-special-modes-alist' entry for `bibtex-mode'.

For some major modes, `forward-sexp' does not work properly.  In those
cases, FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC specifies another function to use instead.

See the documentation for `hs-adjust-block-beginning' to see what is the
use of ADJUST-BEG-FUNC.

If any of the elements is left nil or omitted, hideshow tries to guess
appropriate values.  The regexps should not contain leading or trailing
whitespace.  Case does not matter.")

(autoload 'idlwave-mode "idlwave" "\
Major mode for editing IDL source files (version 6.1_em22).

The main features of this mode are

1. Indentation and Formatting
   --------------------------
   Like other Emacs programming modes, C-j inserts a newline and indents.
   TAB is used for explicit indentation of the current line.

   To start a continuation line, use \\[idlwave-split-line].  This
   function can also be used in the middle of a line to split the line
   at that point.  When used inside a long constant string, the string
   is split at that point with the `+' concatenation operator.

   Comments are indented as follows:

   `;;;' Indentation remains unchanged.
   `;;'  Indent like the surrounding code
   `;'   Indent to a minimum column.

   The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.

   Use \\[idlwave-fill-paragraph] to refill a paragraph inside a
   comment.  The indentation of the second line of the paragraph
   relative to the first will be retained.  Use
   \\[idlwave-auto-fill-mode] to toggle auto-fill mode for these
   comments.  When the variable `idlwave-fill-comment-line-only' is
   nil, code can also be auto-filled and auto-indented.

   To convert pre-existing IDL code to your formatting style, mark the
   entire buffer with \\[mark-whole-buffer] and execute
   \\[idlwave-expand-region-abbrevs].  Then mark the entire buffer
   again followed by \\[indent-region] (`indent-region').

2. Routine Info
   ------------
   IDLWAVE displays information about the calling sequence and the
   accepted keyword parameters of a procedure or function with
   \\[idlwave-routine-info].  \\[idlwave-find-module] jumps to the
   source file of a module.  These commands know about system
   routines, all routines in idlwave-mode buffers and (when the
   idlwave-shell is active) about all modules currently compiled under
   this shell.  It also makes use of pre-compiled or custom-scanned
   user and library catalogs many popular libraries ship with by
   default.  Use \\[idlwave-update-routine-info] to update this
   information, which is also used for completion (see item 4).

3. Online IDL Help
   ---------------

   \\[idlwave-context-help] displays the IDL documentation relevant
   for the system variable, keyword, or routines at point.  A single
   key stroke gets you directly to the right place in the docs.  See
   the manual to configure where and how the HTML help is displayed.

4. Completion
   ----------
   \\[idlwave-complete] completes the names of procedures, functions
   class names, keyword parameters, system variables and tags, class
   tags, structure tags, filenames and much more.  It is context
   sensitive and figures out what is expected at point.  Lower case
   strings are completed in lower case, other strings in mixed or
   upper case.

5. Code Templates and Abbreviations
   --------------------------------
   Many Abbreviations are predefined to expand to code fragments and templates.
   The abbreviations start generally with a `\\'.  Some examples:

   \\pr        PROCEDURE template
   \\fu        FUNCTION template
   \\c         CASE statement template
   \\sw        SWITCH statement template
   \\f         FOR loop template
   \\r         REPEAT Loop template
   \\w         WHILE loop template
   \\i         IF statement template
   \\elif      IF-ELSE statement template
   \\b         BEGIN

   For a full list, use \\[idlwave-list-abbrevs].  Some templates also
   have direct keybindings - see the list of keybindings below.

   \\[idlwave-doc-header] inserts a documentation header at the
   beginning of the current program unit (pro, function or main).
   Change log entries can be added to the current program unit with
   \\[idlwave-doc-modification].

6. Automatic Case Conversion
   -------------------------
   The case of reserved words and some abbrevs is controlled by
   `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase' and `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.

7. Automatic END completion
   ------------------------
   If the variable `idlwave-expand-generic-end' is non-nil, each END typed
   will be converted to the specific version, like ENDIF, ENDFOR, etc.

8. Hooks
   -----
   Loading idlwave.el runs `idlwave-load-hook'.
   Turning on `idlwave-mode' runs `idlwave-mode-hook'.

9. Documentation and Customization
   -------------------------------
   Info documentation for this package is available.  Use
   \\[idlwave-info] to display (complain to your sysadmin if that does
   not work).  For Postscript, PDF, and HTML versions of the
   documentation, check IDLWAVE's homepage at URL
   `http://github.com/jdtsmith/idlwave'.
   IDLWAVE has customize support - see the group `idlwave'.

10.Keybindings
   -----------
   Here is a list of all keybindings of this mode.
   If some of the key bindings below show with ??, use \\[describe-key]
   followed by the key sequence to see what the key sequence does.

Default list of directories to search for Info documentation files.
They are searched in the order they are given in the list.
Therefore, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs
normally should come last (so that local files override standard ones),
unless Emacs is installed into a non-standard directory.  In the latter
case, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs should be
first in this list.

Once Info is started, the list of directories to search

This variable `Info-default-directory-list' is used as the default
for initializing `Info-directory-list' when Info is started, unless
the environment variable INFOPATH is set.

\\<Info-mode-map>\\[Info-help]	Invoke the Info tutorial.
\\[Info-exit]	Quit Info: reselect previously selected buffer.

Selecting other nodes:
\\[Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node]
	Follow a node reference you click on.
	  This works with menu items, cross references, and
	  the \"next\", \"previous\" and \"up\", depending on where you click.
\\[Info-follow-nearest-node]	Follow a node reference near point, like \\[Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node].
\\[Info-next]	Move to the \"next\" node of this node.
\\[Info-prev]	Move to the \"previous\" node of this node.
\\[Info-up]	Move \"up\" from this node.
\\[Info-menu]	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).
	  Picking a menu item causes another node to be selected.
\\[Info-directory]	Go to the Info directory node.
\\[Info-top-node]	Go to the Top node of this file.
\\[Info-final-node]	Go to the final node in this file.
\\[Info-backward-node]	Go backward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.
\\[Info-forward-node]	Go forward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.
\\[Info-next-reference]	Move cursor to next cross-reference or menu item.
\\[Info-prev-reference]	Move cursor to previous cross-reference or menu item.
\\[Info-follow-reference]	Follow a cross reference.  Reads name of reference.
\\[Info-history-back]	Move back in history to the last node you were at.
\\[Info-history-forward]	Move forward in history to the node you returned from after using \\[Info-history-back].
\\[Info-history]	Go to menu of visited nodes.
\\[Info-toc]	Go to table of contents of the current Info file.

Moving within a node:
\\[Info-scroll-up]	Normally, scroll forward a full screen.
	  Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the
	  screen but after point, the next scroll moves into its first
	  subnode.  When after all menu items (or if there is no menu),
	  move up to the parent node.
\\[Info-scroll-down]	Normally, scroll backward.  If the beginning of the buffer is
	  already visible, try to go to the previous menu entry, or up
	  if there is none.
\\[beginning-of-buffer]	Go to beginning of node.

Advanced commands:
\\[Info-search]	Search through this Info file for specified regexp,
	  and select the node in which the next occurrence is found.
\\[Info-search-case-sensitively]	Search through this Info file for specified regexp case-sensitively.
\\[isearch-forward], \\[isearch-forward-regexp]	Use Isearch to search through multiple Info nodes.
\\[Info-index]	Search for a topic in this manual's Index and go to index entry.
\\[Info-index-next]	(comma) Move to the next match from a previous \\<Info-mode-map>\\[Info-index] command.
\\[Info-virtual-index]	Look for a string and display the index node with results.
\\[info-apropos]	Look for a string in the indices of all manuals.
\\[Info-goto-node]	Move to node specified by name.
	  You may include a filename as well, as (FILENAME)NODENAME.
1 .. 9	Pick first ... ninth item in node's menu.
	  Every third `*' is highlighted to help pick the right number.
\\[Info-copy-current-node-name]	Put name of current Info node in the kill ring.
\\[clone-buffer]	Select a new cloned Info buffer in another window.
\\[universal-argument] \\[info]	Move to new Info file with completion.
\\[universal-argument] N \\[info]	Select Info buffer with prefix number in the name *info*<N>.

Finding the right place in the .texi is a manual process.

When a target info file doesn't exist there's obviously no way to

simply that you don't have the target installed, or it could be a
mistake in the reference.

foo.info to `info-xref-check' and it traverses all sub-files.
Compressed info files are accepted too as usual for `Info-mode'.

Major mode for editing standard Makefiles.

If you are editing a file for a different make, try one of the
variants `makefile-automake-mode', `makefile-gmake-mode',
`makefile-makepp-mode', `makefile-bsdmake-mode' or,
`makefile-imake-mode'.  All but the last should be correctly
chosen based on the file name, except if it is *.mk.  This
function ends by invoking the function(s) `makefile-mode-hook'.

It is strongly recommended to use `font-lock-mode', because that
provides additional parsing information.  This is used for
example to see that a rule action `echo foo: bar' is a not rule
dependency, despite the colon.

\\{makefile-mode-map}

In the browser, use the following keys:

\\{makefile-browser-map}

Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:

`makefile-browser-buffer-name':
    Name of the macro- and target browser buffer.

`makefile-target-colon':
    The string that gets appended to all target names
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.
    \":\" or \"::\" are quite common values.

`makefile-macro-assign':
   The string that gets appended to all macro names
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.
   The normal value should be \" = \", since this is what
   standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you
   might prefer to use \" += \" or \" := \" .

`makefile-tab-after-target-colon':
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.

`makefile-browser-leftmost-column':
   Number of blanks to the left of the browser selection mark.

`makefile-browser-cursor-column':
   Column in which the cursor is positioned when it moves
   up or down in the browser.

`makefile-browser-selected-mark':
   String used to mark selected entries in the browser.

`makefile-browser-unselected-mark':
   String used to mark unselected entries in the browser.

`makefile-browser-auto-advance-after-selection-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value the cursor
   will automagically advance to the next line after an item
   has been selected in the browser.

`makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-pickup-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise
   filenames are omitted.

`makefile-cleanup-continuations':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then Makefile mode
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving
   the backslash itself intact.
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes Makefile mode
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when \"it seems necessary\".

`makefile-browser-hook':
   A function or list of functions to be called just before the
   browser is entered. This is executed in the makefile buffer.

`makefile-special-targets-list':
   List of special targets. You will be offered to complete
   on one of those in the minibuffer whenever you enter a `.'.
   at the beginning of a line in Makefile mode.

If a buffer already exists for this man page, it will be displayed
without running the man command.

For a manpage from a particular section, use either of the
following.  \"cat(1)\" is how cross-references appear and is
passed to man as \"1 cat\".

    cat(1)

Ranges
======
Many commands that operate on individual messages, such as
`mh-forward' or `mh-refile-msg' take a RANGE argument. This argument
can be used in several ways.

If you provide the prefix argument (\\[universal-argument]) to
these commands, then you will be prompted for the message range.
This can be any valid MH range which can include messages,
sequences, and the abbreviations (described in the mh(1) man
page):

<num1>-<num2>
    Indicates all messages in the range <num1> to <num2>, inclusive.
    The range must be nonempty.

<num>:N
<num>:+N
<num>:-N
    Up to N messages beginning with (or ending with) message num. Num
    may be any of the predefined symbols: first, prev, cur, next or
    last.

first:N
prev:N
next:N
last:N
    The first, previous, next or last messages, if they exist.

all
    All of the messages.

For example, a range that shows all of these things is `1 2 3
5-10 last:5 unseen'.

If the option `transient-mark-mode' is set to t and you set a
region in the MH-Folder buffer, then the MH-E command will
perform the operation on all messages in that region.

Open a TCP connection to HOST, optionally with encryption.
Normally, return a network process object; with a non-nil
:return-list parameter, return a list instead (see below).
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process'
closes it.

NAME is the name for the process.  It is modified if necessary to
 make it unique.
BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer.  BUFFER may be nil,
 meaning that the process is not associated with any buffer.
HOST is the name or IP address of the host to connect to.
SERVICE is the name of the service desired, or an integer or
 integer string specifying a port number to connect to.

The remaining PARAMETERS should be a sequence of keywords and
values:

:type specifies the connection type, one of the following:
  nil or `network'
             -- Begin with an ordinary network connection, and if
                the parameters :success and :capability-command
                are also supplied, try to upgrade to an encrypted
                connection via STARTTLS.  Even if that
                fails (e.g. if HOST does not support TLS), retain
                an unencrypted connection.
  `plain'    -- An ordinary, unencrypted network connection.
  `starttls' -- Begin with an ordinary connection, and try
                upgrading via STARTTLS.  If that fails for any
                reason, drop the connection; in that case the
                returned object is a killed process.
  `tls'      -- A TLS connection.
  `ssl'      -- Equivalent to `tls'.
  `shell'    -- A shell connection.

:return-list specifies this function's return value.
  If omitted or nil, return a process object.  A non-nil means to
  return (PROC . PROPS), where PROC is a process object and PROPS
  is a plist of connection properties, with these keywords:
   :greeting -- the greeting returned by HOST (a string), or nil.
   :capabilities -- a string representing HOST's capabilities,
                    or nil if none could be found.
   :type -- the resulting connection type; `plain' (unencrypted)
            or `tls' (TLS-encrypted).

:end-of-command specifies a regexp matching the end of a command.

:end-of-capability specifies a regexp matching the end of the
  response to the command specified for :capability-command.
  It defaults to the regexp specified for :end-of-command.

:success specifies a regexp matching a message indicating a
  successful STARTTLS negotiation.  For instance, the default
  should be \"^3\" for an NNTP connection.

:capability-command specifies a command used to query the HOST
  for its capabilities.  For instance, for IMAP this should be
  \"1 CAPABILITY\\r\\n\".

:starttls-function specifies a function for handling STARTTLS.
  This function should take one parameter, the response to the
  capability command, and should return the command to switch on
  STARTTLS if the server supports STARTTLS, and nil otherwise.

:always-query-capabilities says whether to query the server for
  capabilities, even if we're doing a `plain' network connection.

:client-certificate should either be a list where the first
  element is the certificate key file name, and the second
  element is the certificate file name itself, or t, which
  means that `auth-source' will be queried for the key and the
  certificate.  This parameter will only be used when doing TLS
  or STARTTLS connections.

:use-starttls-if-possible is a boolean that says to do opportunistic
STARTTLS upgrades even if Emacs doesn't have built-in TLS functionality.

:warn-unless-encrypted is a boolean which, if :return-list is
non-nil, is used warn the user if the connection isn't encrypted.

:nogreeting is a boolean that can be used to inhibit waiting for
a greeting from the server.

:nowait, if non-nil, says the connection should be made
asynchronously, if possible.

:shell-command is a format-spec string that can be used if :type
is `shell'.  It has two specs, %s for host and %p for port
number.  Example: \"ssh gateway nc %s %p\".

:tls-parameters is a list that should be supplied if you're
opening a TLS connection.  The first element is the TLS
type (either `gnutls-x509pki' or `gnutls-anon'), and the
remaining elements should be a keyword list accepted by
gnutls-boot (as returned by `gnutls-boot-parameters').

\\[nxml-finish-element] finishes the current element by inserting an end-tag.
C-c C-i closes a start-tag with `>' and then inserts a balancing end-tag
leaving point between the start-tag and end-tag.
\\[nxml-balanced-close-start-tag-block] is similar but for block rather than inline elements:
the start-tag, point, and end-tag are all left on separate lines.
If `nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag' is non-nil, then inserting a `</'
automatically inserts the rest of the end-tag.

\\[completion-at-point] performs completion on the symbol preceding point.

\\[nxml-dynamic-markup-word] uses the contents of the current buffer
to choose a tag to put around the word preceding point.

Sections of the document can be displayed in outline form.  The
variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' controls when an element
is recognized as a section.  The same key sequences that change
visibility in outline mode are used except that they start with C-c C-o
instead of C-c.

Validation is provided by the related minor-mode `rng-validate-mode'.
This also makes completion schema- and context- sensitive.  Element
names, attribute names, attribute values and namespace URIs can all be
completed. By default, `rng-validate-mode' is automatically enabled.
You can toggle it using \\[rng-validate-mode] or change the default by
customizing `rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag'.

\\[indent-for-tab-command] indents the current line appropriately.
This can be customized using the variable `nxml-child-indent'
and the variable `nxml-attribute-indent'.

\\[nxml-insert-named-char] inserts a character reference using
the character's name (by default, the Unicode name).
\\[universal-argument] \\[nxml-insert-named-char] inserts the character directly.

The Emacs commands that normally operate on balanced expressions will
operate on XML markup items.  Thus \\[forward-sexp] will move forward
across one markup item; \\[backward-sexp] will move backward across
one markup item; \\[kill-sexp] will kill the following markup item;
\\[mark-sexp] will mark the following markup item.  By default, each
tag each treated as a single markup item; to make the complete element
be treated as a single markup item, set the variable
`nxml-sexp-element-flag' to t.  For more details, see the function
`nxml-forward-balanced-item'.

\\[nxml-backward-up-element] and \\[nxml-down-element] move up and down the element structure.

\\[customize-group] nxml RET.

TAB-action and visibility cycling for Org mode.

This is the command invoked in Org mode by the `TAB' key.  Its main
purpose is outline visibility cycling, but it also invokes other actions
in special contexts.

When this function is called with a `\\[universal-argument]' prefix, rotate the entire
buffer through 3 states (global cycling)
  1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headlines.
  2. CONTENTS: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
  3. SHOW ALL: Show everything.

With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' prefix argument, switch to the startup visibility,
determined by the variable `org-startup-folded', and by any VISIBILITY
properties in the buffer.

With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' prefix argument, show the entire buffer, including
any drawers.

When inside a table, re-align the table and move to the next field.

When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree started
by this line through 3 different states (local cycling)
  1. FOLDED:   Only the main headline is shown.
  2. CHILDREN: The main headline and the direct children are shown.
               From this state, you can move to one of the children
               and zoom in further.
  3. SUBTREE:  Show the entire subtree, including body text.
If there is no subtree, switch directly from CHILDREN to FOLDED.

When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable
`org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation' is set, cycle the level
of the headline by demoting and promoting it to likely levels.  This
speeds up creation document structure by pressing `TAB' once or several
times right after creating a new headline.

When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do
a `show-subtree' and return to the previous cursor position.  If ARG
is negative, go up that many levels.

When point is not at the beginning of a headline, execute the global
binding for `TAB', which is re-indenting the line.  See the option
`org-cycle-emulate-tab' for details.

As a special case, if point is at the beginning of the buffer and there is
no headline in line 1, this function will act as if called with prefix arg

Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

Evaluate EXP and attempt to match it against structural patterns.
CASES is a list of elements of the form (PATTERN CODE...).

A structural PATTERN describes a template that identifies a class
of values.  For example, the pattern \\=`(,foo ,bar) matches any
two element list, binding its elements to symbols named `foo' and
`bar' -- in much the same way that `cl-destructuring-bind' would.

A significant difference from `cl-destructuring-bind' is that, if
a pattern match fails, the next case is tried until either a
successful match is found or there are no more cases.

Another difference is that pattern elements may be quoted,
meaning they must match exactly: The pattern \\='(foo bar)
matches only against two element lists containing the symbols
`foo' and `bar' in that order.  (As a short-hand, atoms always
match themselves, such as numbers or strings, and need not be
quoted.)

Lastly, a pattern can be logical, such as (pred numberp), that
matches any number-like element; or the symbol `_', that matches
anything.  Also, when patterns are backquoted, a comma may be
used to introduce logical patterns inside backquoted patterns.

The complete list of standard patterns is as follows:

  _		matches anything.
  SYMBOL	matches anything and binds it to SYMBOL.
                If a SYMBOL is used twice in the same pattern
                the second occurrence becomes an `eq'uality test.
  (or PAT...)	matches if any of the patterns matches.
  (and PAT...)	matches if all the patterns match.
  \\='VAL		matches if the object is `equal' to VAL.
  ATOM		is a shorthand for \\='ATOM.
		   ATOM can be a keyword, an integer, or a string.
  (pred FUN)	matches if FUN applied to the object returns non-nil.
  (guard BOOLEXP)	matches if BOOLEXP evaluates to non-nil.
  (let PAT EXP)	matches if EXP matches PAT.
  (app FUN PAT)	matches if FUN applied to the object matches PAT.

Additional patterns can be defined using `pcase-defmacro'.

The FUN argument in the `app' pattern may have the following forms:
  SYMBOL or (lambda ARGS BODY)  in which case it's called with one argument.
  (F ARG1 .. ARGn) in which case F gets called with an n+1'th argument
                        which is the value being matched.
So a FUN of the form SYMBOL is equivalent to (FUN).
FUN can refer to variables bound earlier in the pattern.

See Info node `(elisp) Pattern matching case statement' in the
Emacs Lisp manual for more information and examples.

\\{perl-mode-map}
Variables controlling indentation style:
 `perl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in Perl mode should always indent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `perl-tab-to-comment'
    Non-nil means that for lines which don't need indenting, TAB will
    either delete an empty comment, indent an existing comment, move
    to end-of-line, or if at end-of-line already, create a new comment.
 `perl-nochange'
    Lines starting with this regular expression are not auto-indented.
 `perl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `perl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 `perl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `perl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `perl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `perl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 `perl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `perl-indent-continued-arguments'
    Offset of argument lines relative to usual indentation.

Various indentation styles:       K&R  BSD  BLK  GNU  LW

Fast fire function for PostScript printing.

If a region is active, the region will be printed instead of the whole buffer.
Also if the current major-mode is defined in `pr-mode-alist', the settings in
`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be
printed using `pr-ps-mode-ps-print'.


Interactively, you have the following situations:

   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and printing will
      immediately be done using the current active printer.

   C-u   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
   C-u 0 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a current
      PostScript printer, then printing will immediately be done using the new
      current active printer.

   C-u 1 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a file name,
      and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
      printer.

   C-u 2 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value, then for a current
      PostScript printer and, finally, for a file name.  Then change the active
      printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in
      that file instead of sending it to the printer.


Noninteractively, the argument N-UP should be a positive integer greater than
zero and the argument SELECT is treated as follows:

   If it's nil, send the image to the printer.

   If it's a list or an integer lesser or equal to zero, the command prompts
   the user for a current PostScript printer, then printing will immediately
   be done using the new current active printer.

   If it's an integer equal to 1, the command prompts the user for a file name
   and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
   printer.

   If it's an integer greater or equal to 2, the command prompts the user for a
   current PostScript printer and for a file name.  Then change the active
   printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in that file
   instead of sending it to the printer.

   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-ps-printer-alist', it's the new
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active
   printer.

   Otherwise, send the image to the printer.

are both set to t.

(autoload 'quail-define-package "quail" "\
Define NAME as a new Quail package for input LANGUAGE.
TITLE is a string to be displayed at mode-line to indicate this package.
Optional arguments are GUIDANCE, DOCSTRING, TRANSLATION-KEYS,
 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.

GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.

DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.  The command
`describe-input-method' shows this string while replacing the form
\\=\\<VAR> in the string by the value of VAR.  That value should be a
string.  For instance, the form \\=\\<quail-translation-docstring> is
replaced by a description about how to select a translation from a
list of candidates.

TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.

FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.

DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.

KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.

SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the function `quail-help' (as used by
the command `describe-input-method') should show the user's keyboard
layout visually with translated characters.  If KBD-TRANSLATE is
set, it is desirable to also set this flag, unless this package
defines no translations for single character keys.

CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.

MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key \"..ABCD\" but have translations of \"..AB\" and \"CD..\", break
the key at \"..AB\" and start translation of \"CD..\".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at \"..ABC\" and start translation of \"D..\".

OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.

UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By
default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation
for it) is inserted.

CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.

If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of
commands such as C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p and TAB; they are treated as
non-Quail commands.

This function translates user input into responses by consulting

Translate regular expressions REGEXPS in sexp form to a regexp string.
REGEXPS is a non-empty sequence of forms of the sort listed below.

Note that `rx' is a Lisp macro; when used in a Lisp program being
compiled, the translation is performed by the compiler.
See `rx-to-string' for how to do such a translation at run-time.

The following are valid subforms of regular expressions in sexp
notation.

STRING
     matches string STRING literally.

CHAR
     matches character CHAR literally.

`not-newline', `nonl'
     matches any character except a newline.

`anything'
     matches any character

`(any SET ...)'
`(in SET ...)'
`(char SET ...)'
     matches any character in SET ....  SET may be a character or string.
     Ranges of characters can be specified as `A-Z' in strings.
     Ranges may also be specified as conses like `(?A . ?Z)'.

     SET may also be the name of a character class: `digit',
     `control', `hex-digit', `blank', `graph', `print', `alnum',
     `alpha', `ascii', `nonascii', `lower', `punct', `space', `upper',
     `word', or one of their synonyms.

`(not (any SET ...))'
     matches any character not in SET ...

`line-start', `bol'
     matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a line
     in the text being matched

`line-end', `eol'
     is similar to `line-start' but matches only at the end of a line

`string-start', `bos', `bot'
     matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of the
     string being matched against.

`string-end', `eos', `eot'
     matches the empty string, but only at the end of the
     string being matched against.

`buffer-start'
     matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of the
     buffer being matched against.  Actually equivalent to `string-start'.

`buffer-end'
     matches the empty string, but only at the end of the
     buffer being matched against.  Actually equivalent to `string-end'.

`point'
     matches the empty string, but only at point.

`word-start', `bow'
     matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a word.

`word-end', `eow'
     matches the empty string, but only at the end of a word.

`word-boundary'
     matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a
     word.

`(not word-boundary)'
`not-word-boundary'
     matches the empty string, but not at the beginning or end of a
     word.

     spaces, tabs, and other characters whose Unicode
     `general-category' property indicates they are spacing
     separators.

`graphic', `graph'
     matches graphic characters--everything except whitespace, ASCII
     and non-ASCII control characters, surrogates, and codepoints
     unassigned by Unicode.

`printing', `print'
     matches whitespace and graphic characters.

`alphanumeric', `alnum'
     matches alphabetic characters and digits.  (For multibyte characters,
     it matches according to Unicode character properties.)

`letter', `alphabetic', `alpha'

     `punctuation'		(\\s.)
     `word'			(\\sw)
     `symbol'			(\\s_)
     `open-parenthesis'		(\\s()

     `string-delimiter'		(\\s|)
     `comment-delimiter'	(\\s!)

`(not (syntax SYNTAX))'

     `vietnamese'			(\\cv)
     `hebrew'				(\\cw)
     `cyrillic'				(\\cy)
     `can-break'			(\\c|)

`(not (category CATEGORY))'
     matches a character that doesn't have category CATEGORY.

`(and SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(: SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(seq SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(sequence SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches what SEXP1 matches, followed by what SEXP2 matches, etc.

`(submatch SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(group SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     like `and', but makes the match accessible with `match-end',
     `match-beginning', and `match-string'.

`(submatch-n N SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(group-n N SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     like `group', but make it an explicitly-numbered group with
     group number N.

`(or SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(| SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches anything that matches SEXP1 or SEXP2, etc.  If all
     args are strings, use `regexp-opt' to optimize the resulting
     regular expression.

`(minimal-match SEXP)'
     produce a non-greedy regexp for SEXP.  Normally, regexps matching
     zero or more occurrences of something are \"greedy\" in that they
     match as much as they can, as long as the overall regexp can
     still match.  A non-greedy regexp matches as little as possible.

`(maximal-match SEXP)'
     produce a greedy regexp for SEXP.  This is the default.

Below, `SEXP ...' represents a sequence of regexp forms, treated as if
enclosed in `(and ...)'.

`(zero-or-more SEXP ...)'
`(0+ SEXP ...)'
     matches zero or more occurrences of what SEXP ... matches.

`(* SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp, independent
     of `rx-greedy-flag'.

`(*? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp,
     independent of `rx-greedy-flag'.

`(one-or-more SEXP ...)'
`(1+ SEXP ...)'
     matches one or more occurrences of SEXP ...

`(+ SEXP ...)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(+? SEXP ...)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(zero-or-one SEXP ...)'
`(optional SEXP ...)'
`(opt SEXP ...)'
     matches zero or one occurrences of A.

`(? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(?? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(repeat N SEXP)'
`(= N SEXP ...)'
     matches N occurrences.

`(>= N SEXP ...)'
     matches N or more occurrences.

`(repeat N M SEXP)'
`(** N M SEXP ...)'
     matches N to M occurrences.

`(backref N)'
     matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(eval FORM)'
     evaluate FORM and insert result.  If result is a string,
     `regexp-quote' it.

`(regexp REGEXP)'
     include REGEXP in string notation in the result.

keep the old contents or to erase them.  If NOERASE has the value
`new', a new mail buffer will be created instead of using the old

enter text, enclose it in double quotes.)

In an expression, you can use cell coordinates to refer to the

area, and let SES manage the data area outside the visible region.

To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:

<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.

<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal M-o or
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.

Pages can have <a name=\"SOMENAME\">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href=\"#SOMENAME\">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href=\"URL\">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.

Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src=\"URL\">.

If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.

Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.  Shell script files can use the `sh-shell' local
variable to indicate the shell variant to be used for the file.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:
\\<sh-mode-map>
\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\\[sh-select]	 select loop
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
\\[sh-show-indent]	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.
\\[sh-set-indent]	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.
\\[sh-learn-line-indent]	Change the indentation variable so this line
would indent to the way it currently is.
\\[sh-learn-buffer-indent]  Set the indentation variables so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.


\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two
unquoted < insert a here document.  You can control this behavior by
modifying `sh-mode-hook'.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.

If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use \\[executable-interpret]
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.

Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.

If STRINGP is non-nil, returns any shadows as a string.
Otherwise, if interactive shows any shadows in a `*Shadows*' buffer;
else prints messages listing any shadows.

This function lists potential load path problems.  Directories in
the `load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is \"hidden\" by
the earlier.

For example, suppose `load-path' is set to

\(\"/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp\" \"/usr/share/emacs/24.3/lisp\")

and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
\(require \\='XXX), (autoload .... \"XXX\"), (load-library \"XXX\") etc.

The first XXX.el file prevents Emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via `load-file').

When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of Emacs prior to
24.3.  A system administrator downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the Emacs distribution.
Unless the system administrator checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
Emacs version).

This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
\(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.

Shadowings are located by calling the (non-interactive) companion
function, `load-path-shadows-find'.

With optional second argument REGIONS, wrap first interesting point
\(`_') in skeleton around next REGIONS words, if REGIONS is positive.
If REGIONS is negative, wrap REGIONS preceding interregions into first
REGIONS interesting positions (successive `_'s) in skeleton.

An interregion is the stretch of text between two contiguous marked
points.  If you marked A B C [] (where [] is the cursor) in
alphabetical order, the 3 interregions are simply the last 3 regions.
But if you marked B A [] C, the interregions are B-A, A-[], []-C.

The optional third argument STR, if specified, is the value for the
variable `str' within the skeleton.  When this is non-nil, the
interactor gets ignored, and this should be a valid skeleton element.

When done with skeleton, but before going back to `_'-point, add
a newline (unless `skeleton-end-newline' is nil) and run the hook
`skeleton-end-hook'.

SKELETON is made up as (INTERACTOR ELEMENT ...).  INTERACTOR may be nil if
not needed, a prompt-string or an expression for complex read functions.

If ELEMENT is a string or a character it gets inserted (see also
`skeleton-transformation-function').  Other possibilities are:

	\\n	go to next line and indent according to mode, unless
                this is the first/last element of a skeleton and point
                is at bol/eol
	_	interesting point, interregion here
	-	interesting point, no interregion interaction, overrides
		interesting point set by _
	>	indent line (or interregion if > _) according to major mode
	@	add position to `skeleton-positions'
	&	do next ELEMENT if previous moved point
	|	do next ELEMENT if previous didn't move point
	-NUM	delete NUM preceding characters (see `skeleton-untabify')
	resume:	skipped, continue here if quit is signaled
	nil	skipped

After termination, point will be positioned at the last occurrence of -
or at the first occurrence of _ or at the end of the inserted text.

Note that \\n as the last element of the skeleton only inserts a
newline if not at eol.  If you want to unconditionally insert a newline
at the end of the skeleton, use \"\\n\" instead.  Likewise with \\n
as the first element when at bol.

Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.
ELEMENT may itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted
repeatedly for different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as
the user enters a non-empty string.  \\[keyboard-quit] terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in
such a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a \".. %s ..\" it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list
of strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.

Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return t since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:

	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR
		then: insert previously read string once more
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or nil
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str

What is Solitaire?

I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:

	Le Solitaire
	============

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

	o   o   o   .   o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.

A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .

Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o

That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:

		o   o   o

		.   o   o

	o   o   .   o   o   o   o

	o   .   o   o   o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

(autoload 'sort-subr "sort" "\
General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.

We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces
called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.

Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within sort-subr.

NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.
It moves point to the start of the next record.
It should move point to the end of the buffer if there are no more records.
The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when sort-subr
is called.

ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.
It should move point to the end of the record.

STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or
else the key is the substring between the values of point after
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key
starts at the beginning of the record.

ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the sort key to the end of the sort key.
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the
same as ENDRECFUN.

PREDICATE, if non-nil, is the predicate function for comparing
keys; it is called with two arguments, the keys to compare, and
should return non-nil if the first key should sort before the
second key.  If PREDICATE is nil, comparison is done with `<' if
the keys are numbers, with `compare-buffer-substrings' if the
keys are cons cells (the car and cdr of each cons cell are taken

See `sql-help' on how to create SQLi buffers.

Customization: Entry to this mode runs the `sql-mode-hook'.

When you put a buffer in SQL mode, the buffer stores the last SQLi

For information on how to create multiple SQLi buffers, see
`sql-interactive-mode'.

Note that SQL doesn't have an escape character unless you specify
one.  If you specify backslash as escape character in SQL, you
must tell Emacs.  Here's how to do that in your init file:

Type \\[table-insert] and hit ENTER key.  As it asks table
specification, provide 3 for number of columns, 1 for number of rows,
5 for cell width and 1 for cell height.  Now you shall see the next

Type TAB \\[table-widen-cell] then type TAB M-2 M-7 \\[table-widen-cell] (or \\[universal-argument] 2 7 \\[table-widen-cell]).  Typing
TAB moves the point forward by a cell. The result now looks like this:

what you could have done better was to have had given the complete
width information to `table-insert'.

Cell width(s): 14 6 32

instead of

This would have eliminated the previously mentioned width adjustment
work all together.

(autoload 'table-insert-sequence "table" "\
Travel cells forward while inserting a specified sequence string in each cell.
STR is the base string from which the sequence starts.  When STR is an
empty string then each cell content is erased.  When STR ends with
numerical characters (they may optionally be surrounded by a pair of
parentheses) they are incremented as a decimal number.  Otherwise the
last character in STR is incremented in ASCII code order.  N is the
number of sequence elements to insert.  When N is negative the cell
traveling direction is backward.  When N is zero it travels forward
entire table.  INCREMENT is the increment between adjacent sequence
elements and can be a negative number for effectively decrementing.
INTERVAL is the number of cells to travel between sequence element
insertion which is normally 1.  When zero or less is given for
INTERVAL it is interpreted as number of cells per row so that sequence
is placed straight down vertically as long as the table's cell
structure is uniform.  JUSTIFY is a symbol `left', `center' or
`right' that specifies justification of the inserted string.

Example:

  (progn
    (table-insert 16 3 5 1)
    (table-forward-cell 15)
    (table-insert-sequence \"D0\" -16 1 1 \\='center)

(autoload 'table-capture "table" "\
Convert plain text into a table by capturing the text in the region.
Create a table with the text in region as cell contents.  BEG and END
specify the region.  The text in the region is replaced with a table.
The removed text is inserted in the table.  When optional
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are provided the region contents
is parsed and separated into individual cell contents by using the
delimiter regular expressions.  This parsing determines the number of
columns and rows of the table automatically.  If COL-DELIM-REGEXP and
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are omitted the result table has only one cell and
the entire region contents is placed in that cell.  Optional JUSTIFY
is one of `left', `center' or `right', which specifies the cell
justification.  Optional MIN-CELL-WIDTH specifies the minimum cell
width.  Optional COLUMNS specify the number of columns when
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP is not specified.


Example 1:

1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8
, 9, 10

Running `table-capture' on above 3 line region with COL-DELIM-REGEXP
\",\" and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP \"\\n\" creates the following table.  In
this example the cells are centered and minimum cell width is
specified as 5.

+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Note:

In case the function is called interactively user must use \\[quoted-insert] `quoted-insert'
in order to enter \"\\n\" successfully.  COL-DELIM-REGEXP at the end
of each row is optional.


Example 2:

This example shows how a table can be used for text layout editing.
Let `table-capture' capture the following region starting from
-!- and ending at -*-, that contains three paragraphs and two item
name headers.  This time specify empty string for both
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP.

-!-`table-capture' is a powerful command however mastering its power
requires some practice.  Here is a list of items what it can do.

Parse Cell Items      By using column delimiter regular
		      expression and raw delimiter regular
		      expression, it parses the specified text
		      area and extracts cell items from
		      non-table text and then forms a table out
		      of them.

Capture Text Area     When no delimiters are specified it
		      creates a single cell table.  The text in
		      the specified region is placed in that
		      cell.-*-

Now the entire content is captured in a cell which is itself a table
like this.

Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \\[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \\[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \\[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \\[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

Here are the functions:

    texinfo-update-node                \\[texinfo-update-node]
    texinfo-every-node-update          \\[texinfo-every-node-update]
    texinfo-sequential-node-update

    texinfo-make-menu                  \\[texinfo-make-menu]
    texinfo-all-menus-update           \\[texinfo-all-menus-update]
    texinfo-master-menu

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'.

(custom-autoload 'type-break-mode "type-break" nil)

(autoload 'type-break-mode "type-break" "\
Enable or disable typing-break mode.
This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.

When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, Emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.

A negative prefix argument disables this mode.
No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.

The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.

If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.

The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.

If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if Emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.  A nil value for this variable prevents automatic
break rescheduling, making `type-break-interval' an upper bound on the time
between breaks.  In this case breaks will be prompted for as usual before
the upper bound if the keystroke threshold is reached.

If `type-break-good-rest-interval' is nil and
`type-break-good-break-interval' is set, then confirmation is required to
interrupt a break before `type-break-good-break-interval' seconds
have passed.  This provides for an upper bound on the time between breaks
together with confirmation of interruptions to these breaks.

The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.

There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about
imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:

        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'
        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-keystroke-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-warning-repeat'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'

There are several variables that affect if, how, and when queries to begin
a typing break occur.  They include:

        `type-break-query-mode'
        `type-break-query-function'
        `type-break-query-interval'

The command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things.

Finally, a file (named `type-break-file-name') is used to store information
across Emacs sessions.  This provides recovery of the break status between
sessions and after a crash.  Manual changes to the file may result in
problems.

Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.

If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your
maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate
average typing speed.)

From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of
the computed maximum threshold.

When called from Lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.
FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.

Display the edit history of the current FILE using colors.

This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current

used to show the age of each line--blue means oldest, red means
youngest, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a revision number REV; then the buffer
displays and annotates that revision instead of the working revision
\(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,
you are prompted for the time span in days which the color range
should cover.  For example, a time span of 20 days means that changes
over the past 20 days are shown in red to blue, according to their
age, and everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

Major mode for editing Vera code.

Usage:
------

  INDENTATION:  Typing `TAB' at the beginning of a line indents the line.
    The amount of indentation is specified by option `vera-basic-offset'.
    Indentation can be done for an entire region (`M-C-\\') or buffer (menu).
    `TAB' always indents the line if option `vera-intelligent-tab' is nil.

  WORD/COMMAND COMPLETION:  Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks
    for a word in the buffer or a Vera keyword that starts alike, inserts it
    and adjusts case.  Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word
    completions.

    Typing `TAB' after a non-word character inserts a tabulator stop (if not
    at the beginning of a line).  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator stop.

  COMMENTS:  `C-c C-c' comments out a region if not commented out, and
    uncomments a region if already commented out.

  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Vera keywords, predefined types and
    constants, function names, declaration names, directives, as well as
    comments and strings are highlighted using different colors.

  VERA VERSION:  OpenVera 1.4 and Vera version 6.2.8.

Turning on Verilog mode calls the value of the variable `verilog-mode-hook'

Variables controlling indentation/edit style:

 variable `verilog-indent-level'      (default 3)
   Indentation of Verilog statements with respect to containing block.
 `verilog-indent-level-module'        (default 3)
   Absolute indentation of Module level Verilog statements.
   Set to 0 to get initial and always statements lined up
   on the left side of your screen.
 `verilog-indent-level-declaration'   (default 3)
   Indentation of declarations with respect to containing block.
   Set to 0 to get them list right under containing block.
 `verilog-indent-level-behavioral'    (default 3)
   Indentation of first begin in a task or function block
   Set to 0 to get such code to lined up underneath the task or
   function keyword.
 `verilog-indent-level-directive'     (default 1)
   Indentation of \\=`ifdef/\\=`endif blocks.
 `verilog-cexp-indent'              (default 1)
   Indentation of Verilog statements broken across lines i.e.:
      if (a)
        begin
 `verilog-case-indent'              (default 2)
   Indentation for case statements.
 `verilog-auto-newline'             (default nil)
   Non-nil means automatically newline after semicolons and the punctuation
   mark after an end.
 `verilog-auto-indent-on-newline'   (default t)
   Non-nil means automatically indent line after newline.
 `verilog-tab-always-indent'        (default t)
   Non-nil means TAB in Verilog mode should always reindent the current line,
   regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `verilog-indent-begin-after-if'    (default t)
   Non-nil means to indent begin statements following a preceding
   if, else, while, for and repeat statements, if any.  Otherwise,
   the begin is lined up with the preceding token.  If t, you get:
      if (a)
         begin // amount of indent based on `verilog-cexp-indent'
   otherwise you get:
      if (a)
      begin
 `verilog-auto-endcomments'         (default t)
   Non-nil means a comment /* ... */ is set after the ends which ends
   cases, tasks, functions and modules.
   The type and name of the object will be set between the braces.
 `verilog-minimum-comment-distance' (default 10)
   Minimum distance (in lines) between begin and end required before a comment
   will be inserted.  Setting this variable to zero results in every
   end acquiring a comment; the default avoids too many redundant
   comments in tight quarters.
 `verilog-auto-lineup'              (default `declarations')
   List of contexts where auto lineup of code should be done.

Variables controlling other actions:

 `verilog-linter'                   (default `surelint')
   Unix program to call to run the lint checker.  This is the default
   command for \\[compile-command] and \\[verilog-auto-save-compile].

    template generation.  Optional arguments are indicated by square
    brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.  Prompts for
    mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is left
    empty.  They can be queried again by `C-c C-t C-q'.  Enabled
    electrification is indicated by `/e' in the mode line.

      Typing `M-SPC' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the
    template generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e.
    electrification) can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-e' or by
    setting option `vhdl-electric-mode' (see OPTIONS).

      Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key
    bindings, by typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing
    the keyword (i.e. first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and
    `SPC'.  The following abbreviations can also be used: arch, attr, cond,
    conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.

      Template styles can be customized in customization group
    `vhdl-template' (see OPTIONS).


  HEADER INSERTION:
    A file header can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-h'.  A file footer
    (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-f'.
    See customization group `vhdl-header'.


  STUTTERING:
    Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax elements.
    Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-s' or by
    option `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in
    the mode line.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:

      ;;   -->  \" : \"       [   -->  (        --    -->  comment
      ;;;  -->  \" := \"      [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code
      ..   -->  \" => \"      ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line
      ,,   -->  \" <= \"      ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment
      ==   -->  \" == \"      \\='\\='  -->  \\\"


  WORD COMPLETION:
    Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL keyword or a
    word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts case.
    Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word completions.  This also
    works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).

      Typing `TAB' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized
    expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as
    standard types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations
    (e.g., type \"std\" and `TAB' will toggle through all standard types
    beginning with \"std\").

      Typing `TAB' after a non-word character indents the line if at the
    beginning of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters), and
    inserts a tabulator stop otherwise.  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator
    stop.


  COMMENTS:
        `--'       puts a single comment.
        `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.
        `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines
                   with a comment in between.
        `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments
                   out following lines.
        `C-c C-c'  comments out a region if not commented out,
                   uncomments a region if already commented out.  Option
                   `comment-style' defines where the comment characters
                   should be placed (beginning of line, indent, etc.).

      You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,
    variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process
    specifications if option `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.
    Comments are automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after
    begin statements) and as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is
    non-nil.

      Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line)
    are indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at
    maximum to `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `RET' after a space in a comment
    will open a new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column'
    in a comment automatically opens a new comment line.  `M-q' re-fills
    multi-line comments.


  INDENTATION:
    `TAB' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.  The amount of
    indentation is specified by option `vhdl-basic-offset'.  `C-c C-i C-l'
    always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if option
    `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).  If a region is active, `TAB' indents
    the entire region.

      Indentation can be done for a group of lines (`C-c C-i C-g'), a region
    (`M-C-\\') or the entire buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are
    indented normally (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil)
    according to option `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.

      If option `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil, spaces are used instead of
    tabs.  `\\[tabify]' and `\\[untabify]' allow the conversion of spaces to
    tabs and vice versa.

      Syntax-based indentation can be very slow in large files.  Option
    `vhdl-indent-syntax-based' allows you to use faster but simpler indentation.

      Option `vhdl-indent-comment-like-next-code-line' controls whether
    comment lines are indented like the preceding or like the following code
    line.


  ALIGNMENT:
    The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline comments
    to beautify the code.  `C-c C-a C-a' aligns a group of consecutive lines
    separated by blank lines, `C-c C-a C-i' a block of lines with same
    indent.  `C-c C-a C-l' aligns all lines belonging to a list enclosed by
    a pair of parentheses (e.g. port clause/map, argument list), and `C-c
    C-a C-d' all lines within the declarative part of a design unit.  `C-c
    C-a M-a' aligns an entire region.  `C-c C-a C-c' aligns inline comments
    for a group of lines, and `C-c C-a M-c' for a region.

      If option `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code lines
    separated by special lines (see option `vhdl-align-group-separate') are
    aligned individually.  If option `vhdl-align-same-indent' is non-nil,
    blocks of lines with same indent are aligned separately.  Some templates
    are automatically aligned after generation if option `vhdl-auto-align'
    is non-nil.

      Alignment tries to align inline comments at
    `vhdl-inline-comment-column' and tries inline comment not to exceed
    `vhdl-end-comment-column'.

      `C-c C-x M-w' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator
    symbols are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.


  CODE FILLING:
    Code filling allows you to condense code (e.g. sensitivity lists or port
    maps) by removing comments and newlines and re-wrapping so that all
    lines are maximally filled (block filling).  `C-c C-f C-f' fills a list
    enclosed by parenthesis, `C-c C-f C-g' a group of lines separated by
    blank lines, `C-c C-f C-i' a block of lines with same indent, and
    `C-c C-f M-f' an entire region.


  CODE BEAUTIFICATION:
    `C-c M-b' and `C-c C-b' beautify the code of a region or of the entire
    buffer respectively.  This includes indentation, alignment, and case
    fixing.  Code beautification can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:

      emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs filename.vhd -f vhdl-beautify-buffer


  PORT TRANSLATION:
    Generic and port clauses from entity or component declarations can be
    copied (`C-c C-p C-w') and pasted as entity and component declarations,
    as component instantiations and corresponding internal constants and
    signals, as a generic map with constants as actual generics, and as
    internal signal initializations (menu).

      To include formals in component instantiations, see option
    `vhdl-association-list-with-formals'.  To include comments in pasting,
    see options `vhdl-include-...-comments'.

      A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be
    flattened (`C-c C-p C-f') so that only one name per line exists.  The
    direction of ports can be reversed (`C-c C-p C-r'), i.e., inputs become
    outputs and vice versa, which can be useful in testbenches.  (This
    reversion is done on the internal data structure and is only reflected
    in subsequent paste operations.)

      Names for actual ports, instances, testbenches, and
    design-under-test instances can be derived from existing names according
    to options `vhdl-...-name'.  See customization group `vhdl-port'.


  SUBPROGRAM TRANSLATION:
    Similar functionality exists for copying/pasting the interface of
    subprograms (function/procedure).  A subprogram interface can be copied
    and then pasted as a subprogram declaration, body or call (uses
    association list with formals).


  TESTBENCH GENERATION:
    A copied port can also be pasted as a testbench.  The generated
    testbench includes an entity, an architecture, and an optional
    configuration.  The architecture contains the component declaration and
    instantiation of the DUT as well as internal constant and signal
    declarations.  Additional user-defined templates can be inserted.  The
    names used for entity/architecture/configuration/DUT as well as the file
    structure to be generated can be customized. See customization group
   `vhdl-testbench'.


  KEY BINDINGS:
    Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in menu).


  VHDL MENU:
    All commands can be found in the VHDL menu including their key bindings.


  FILE BROWSER:
    The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.  It can
    be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if option
    `vhdl-speedbar-auto-open' is non-nil.

      In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and
    browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.


  DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:
    The speedbar can also be used for browsing the hierarchy of design units
    contained in the source files of the current directory or the specified
    projects (see option `vhdl-project-alist').

      The speedbar can be switched between file, directory hierarchy and
    project hierarchy browsing mode in the speedbar menu or by typing `f',
    `h' or `H' in speedbar.

      In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse
    their hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  Ports can directly be copied
    from entities and components (in packages).  Individual design units and
    complete designs can directly be compiled (\"Make\" menu entry).

      The hierarchy is automatically updated upon saving a modified source
    file when option `vhdl-speedbar-update-on-saving' is non-nil.  The
    hierarchy is only updated for projects that have been opened once in the
    speedbar.  The hierarchy is cached between Emacs sessions in a file (see
    options in group `vhdl-speedbar').

      Simple design consistency checks are done during scanning, such as
    multiple declarations of the same unit or missing primary units that are
    required by secondary units.


  STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION:
    Enables simple structural composition.  `C-c C-m C-n' creates a skeleton
    for a new component.  Subcomponents (i.e. component declaration and
    instantiation) can be automatically placed from a previously read port
    (`C-c C-m C-p') or directly from the hierarchy browser (`P').  Finally,
    all subcomponents can be automatically connected using internal signals
    and ports (`C-c C-m C-w') following these rules:
      - subcomponent actual ports with same name are considered to be
        connected by a signal (internal signal or port)
      - signals that are only inputs to subcomponents are considered as
        inputs to this component -> input port created
      - signals that are only outputs from subcomponents are considered as
        outputs from this component -> output port created
      - signals that are inputs to AND outputs from subcomponents are
        considered as internal connections -> internal signal created

      Purpose:  With appropriate naming conventions it is possible to
    create higher design levels with only a few mouse clicks or key
    strokes.  A new design level can be created by simply generating a new
    component, placing the required subcomponents from the hierarchy
    browser, and wiring everything automatically.

      Note: Automatic wiring only works reliably on templates of new
    components and component instantiations that were created by VHDL mode.

      Component declarations can be placed in a components package (option
    `vhdl-use-components-package') which can be automatically generated for
    an entire directory or project (`C-c C-m M-p').  The VHDL'93 direct
    component instantiation is also supported (option
    `vhdl-use-direct-instantiation').

      Configuration declarations can automatically be generated either from
    the menu (`C-c C-m C-f') (for the architecture the cursor is in) or from
    the speedbar menu (for the architecture under the cursor).  The
    configurations can optionally be hierarchical (i.e. include all
    component levels of a hierarchical design, option
    `vhdl-compose-configuration-hierarchical') or include subconfigurations
    (option `vhdl-compose-configuration-use-subconfiguration').  For
    subcomponents in hierarchical configurations, the most-recently-analyzed
    (mra) architecture is selected.  If another architecture is desired, it
    can be marked as most-recently-analyzed (speedbar menu) before
    generating the configuration.

      Note: Configurations of subcomponents (i.e. hierarchical configuration
    declarations) are currently not considered when displaying
    configurations in speedbar.

      See the options group `vhdl-compose' for all relevant user options.


  SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:
    The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed by calling a VHDL
    compiler (menu, `C-c C-k').  The compiler to be used is specified by
    option `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed in option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,
    command options, compilation directory, and error message syntax
    information.  New compilers can be added.

      All the source files of an entire design can be compiled by the `make'
    command (menu, `C-c M-C-k') if an appropriate Makefile exists.


  MAKEFILE GENERATION:
    Makefiles can be generated automatically by an internal generation
    routine (`C-c M-k').  The library unit dependency information is
    obtained from the hierarchy browser.  Makefile generation can be
    customized for each compiler in option `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

      Makefile generation can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:

        emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l vhdl-mode
              [-compiler compilername] [-project projectname]
              -f vhdl-generate-makefile

      The Makefile's default target \"all\" compiles the entire design, the
    target \"clean\" removes it and the target \"library\" creates the
    library directory if not existent.  These target names can be customized
    by option `vhdl-makefile-default-targets'.  The Makefile also includes a
    target for each primary library unit which allows selective compilation
    of this unit, its secondary units and its subhierarchy (example:
    compilation of a design specified by a configuration).  User specific
    parts can be inserted into a Makefile with option
    `vhdl-makefile-generation-hook'.

    Limitations:
      - Only library units and dependencies within the current library are
        considered.  Makefiles for designs that span multiple libraries are
        not (yet) supported.
      - Only one-level configurations are supported (also hierarchical),
        but configurations that go down several levels are not.
      - The \"others\" keyword in configurations is not supported.


  PROJECTS:
    Projects can be defined in option `vhdl-project-alist' and a current
    project be selected using option `vhdl-project' (permanently) or from
    the menu or speedbar (temporarily).  For each project, title and
    description strings (for the file headers), source files/directories
    (for the hierarchy browser and Makefile generation), library name, and
    compiler-dependent options, exceptions and compilation directory can be
    specified.  Compilation settings overwrite the settings of option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

      Project setups can be exported (i.e. written to a file) and imported.
    Imported setups are not automatically saved in `vhdl-project-alist' but
    can be saved afterwards in its customization buffer.  When starting
    Emacs with VHDL Mode (i.e. load a VHDL file or use \"emacs -l
    vhdl-mode\") in a directory with an existing project setup file, it is
    automatically loaded and its project activated if option
    `vhdl-project-auto-load' is non-nil.  Names/paths of the project setup
    files can be specified in option `vhdl-project-file-name'.  Multiple
    project setups can be automatically loaded from global directories.
    This is an alternative to specifying project setups with option
    `vhdl-project-alist'.


  SPECIAL MENUES:
    As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can be added (set
    option `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible as a mouse menu
    (e.g. add \"(global-set-key [S-down-mouse-3] \\='imenu)\" to your start-up
    file) for browsing the file contents (is not populated if buffer is
    larger than 256000).  Also, a source file menu can be
    added (set option `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing the
    current directory for VHDL source files.


  VHDL STANDARDS:
    The VHDL standards to be used are specified in option `vhdl-standard'.
    Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93(02)/'08, VHDL-AMS, and Math Packages.


  KEYWORD CASE:
    Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types, attributes,
    and enumeration values is supported.  If the option
    `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in
    lower case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for
    types, attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords,
    types, attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire
    region (menu) or buffer (`C-c C-x C-c') according to the options
    `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.


  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):
    Keywords and standardized types, attributes, enumeration values, and
    function names (controlled by option `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well
    as comments, strings, and template prompts are highlighted using
    different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal, variable, constant,
    parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well as labels are
    highlighted if option `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.

      Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words
    that should be avoided) can be specified in option
    `vhdl-forbidden-words' or `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in
    a warning color (option `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog
    keywords are highlighted as forbidden words if option
    `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.

      Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their
    syntax and color in option `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting
    option `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows you to
    establish some naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds
    of signals or other objects by using name suffices) and to support them
    visually.

      Option `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order
    to support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only
    highlighted if written in lower case.

      Code between \"translate_off\" and \"translate_on\" pragmas is
    highlighted using a different background color if option
    `vhdl-highlight-translate-off' is non-nil.

      For documentation and customization of the used colors see
    customization group `vhdl-highlight-faces' (`\\[customize-group]').  For
    highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group
    `paren-showing'.  Automatic buffer highlighting is turned on/off by
    option `global-font-lock-mode' (`font-lock-auto-fontify' in XEmacs).


  USER MODELS:
    VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made accessible
    in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword
    electrification.  See option `vhdl-model-alist'.


  HIDE/SHOW:
    The code of blocks, processes, subprograms, component declarations and
    instantiations, generic/port clauses, and configuration declarations can
    be hidden using the `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within
    the code (see customization group `vhdl-menu').  XEmacs: limited
    functionality due to old `hideshow.el' package.


  CODE UPDATING:
    - Sensitivity List: `C-c C-u C-s' updates the sensitivity list of the
      current process, `C-c C-u M-s' of all processes in the current buffer.
      Limitations:
        - Only declared local signals (ports, signals declared in
          architecture and blocks) are automatically inserted.
        - Global signals declared in packages are not automatically inserted.
          Insert them once manually (will be kept afterwards).
        - Out parameters of procedures are considered to be read.
      Use option `vhdl-entity-file-name' to specify the entity file name
      (used to obtain the port names).
      Use option `vhdl-array-index-record-field-in-sensitivity-list' to
      specify whether to include array indices and record fields in
      sensitivity lists.


  CODE FIXING:
    `C-c C-x C-p' fixes the closing parenthesis of a generic/port clause
    (e.g., if the closing parenthesis is on the wrong line or is missing).


  PRINTING:
    PostScript printing with different faces (an optimized set of faces is
    used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors (if
    `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs
    PostScript printing commands.  Option `vhdl-print-two-column' defines
    appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.
    The paper format can be set by option `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to
    switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white
    printers.


  OPTIONS:
    User options allow customization of VHDL Mode.  All options are
    accessible from the \"Options\" menu entry.  Simple options (switches
    and choices) can directly be changed, while for complex options a
    customization buffer is opened.  Changed options can be saved for future
    sessions using the \"Save Options\" menu entry.

      Options and their detailed descriptions can also be accessed by using
    the \"Customize\" menu entry or the command `\\[customize-option]'
    (`\\[customize-group]' for groups).  Some customizations only take effect
    after some action (read the NOTE in the option documentation).
    Customization can also be done globally (i.e. site-wide, read the
    INSTALL file).

      Not all options are described in this documentation, so go and see
    what other useful user options there are (`\\[vhdl-customize]' or menu)!


  FILE EXTENSIONS:
    As default, files with extensions \".vhd\" and \".vhdl\" are
    automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension
    \".xxx\", add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):

      (push \\='(\"\\\\.xxx\\\\\\='\" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist)


  HINTS:
    - To start Emacs with open VHDL hierarchy browser without having to load
      a VHDL file first, use the command:

        emacs -l vhdl-mode -f speedbar-frame-mode

    - Type `C-g C-g' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.

    - Some features only work on properly indented code.

Toggle View mode, a minor mode for viewing text but not editing it.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable View mode if ARG is positive,

When View mode is enabled, commands that do not change the buffer
contents are available as usual.  Kill commands insert text in
kill buffers but do not delete.  Most other commands beep and
tell the user that the buffer is read-only.

take prefix arguments.  Page commands default to \"page size\"
lines which is almost a whole window, or number of lines set by
\\[View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size] or \\[View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size].
Half page commands default to and set \"half page size\" lines
which initially is half a window full.  Search commands default
to a repeat count of one.

H, h, ?	 This message.
Digits	provide prefix arguments.
\\[negative-argument]	negative prefix argument.
\\[beginning-of-buffer]	move to the beginning of buffer.
>	move to the end of buffer.
\\[View-scroll-to-buffer-end]	scroll so that buffer end is at last line of window.
SPC	scroll forward \"page size\" lines.
	  With prefix scroll forward prefix lines.
DEL, S-SPC  scroll backward \"page size\" lines.
	      With prefix scroll backward prefix lines.
\\[View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size]	like  \\[View-scroll-page-forward]  but with prefix sets \"page size\" to prefix.
\\[View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size]	like  \\[View-scroll-page-backward]  but with prefix sets \"page size\" to prefix.
\\[View-scroll-half-page-forward]	scroll forward \"half page size\" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  \"half page size\" to prefix lines and scrolls forward that much.
\\[View-scroll-half-page-backward]	scroll backward \"half page size\" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  \"half page size\" to prefix lines and scrolls backward that much.
RET, LFD  scroll forward one line.  With prefix scroll forward prefix line(s).
y	scroll backward one line.  With prefix scroll backward prefix line(s).
\\[View-revert-buffer-scroll-page-forward]	revert-buffer if necessary and scroll forward.
	  Use this to view a changing file.
\\[what-line]	prints the current line number.
\\[View-goto-percent]	goes prefix argument (default 100) percent into buffer.
\\[View-goto-line]	goes to line given by prefix argument (default first line).
.	set the mark.
x	exchanges point and mark.
\\[View-back-to-mark]	return to mark and pops mark ring.
	  Mark ring is pushed at start of every successful search and when
	  jump to line occurs.  The mark is set on jump to buffer start or end.
\\[point-to-register]	save current position in character register.
\\='	go to position saved in character register.
s	do forward incremental search.
r	do reverse incremental search.
\\[View-search-regexp-forward]	searches forward for regular expression, starting after current page.
	  ! and @ have a special meaning at the beginning of the regexp.
	  ! means search for a line with no match for regexp.  @ means start
	  search at beginning (end for backward search) of buffer.
\\	searches backward for regular expression, starting before current page.
\\[View-search-last-regexp-forward]	searches forward for last regular expression.
p	searches backward for last regular expression.
\\[View-quit]	quit View mode, restoring this window and buffer to previous state.
	  \\[View-quit] is the normal way to leave view mode.
\\[View-exit]	exit View mode but stay in current buffer.  Use this if you started
	  viewing a buffer (file) and find out you want to edit it.
	  This command restores the previous read-only status of the buffer.
\\[View-exit-and-edit]	exit View mode, and make the current buffer editable
	  even if it was not editable before entry to View mode.
\\[View-quit-all]	quit View mode, restoring all windows to previous state.
\\[View-leave]	quit View mode and maybe switch buffers, but don't kill this buffer.
\\[View-kill-and-leave]	quit View mode, kill current buffer and go back to other buffer.

The effect of \\[View-leave], \\[View-quit] and \\[View-kill-and-leave] depends on how view-mode was entered.  If it was
entered by view-file, view-file-other-window, view-file-other-frame, or
\\[dired-view-file] (\\[view-file], \\[view-file-other-window],
\\[view-file-other-frame], or the Dired mode v command),
