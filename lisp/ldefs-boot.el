FUNCTION ::= Name of the function to be advised.

NAME ::= Non-nil symbol that names this piece of advice.
POSITION ::= `first' | `last' | NUMBER. Optional, defaults to `first',

FLAG ::= `protect'|`disable'|`activate'|`compile'|`preactivate'|`freeze'.

Semantics of the various flags:
`protect': The piece of advice will be protected against non-local exits in
any code that precedes it.  If any around-advice of a function is protected
then automatically all around-advices will be protected (the complete onion).

`activate': All advice of FUNCTION will be activated immediately if
FUNCTION has been properly defined prior to this application of `defadvice'.

`compile': In conjunction with `activate' specifies that the resulting
advised function should be compiled.

`disable': The defined advice will be disabled, hence, it will not be used
during activation until somebody enables it.

`preactivate': Preactivates the advised FUNCTION at macro-expansion/compile
time.  This generates a compiled advised definition according to the current
advice state that will be used during activation if appropriate.  Only use
this if the `defadvice' gets actually compiled.

`freeze': Expands the `defadvice' into a redefining `defun/defmacro' according
to this particular single advice.  No other advice information will be saved.
Frozen advices cannot be undone, they behave like a hard redefinition of
the advised function.  `freeze' implies `activate' and `preactivate'.  The
documentation of the advised function can be dumped onto the `DOC' file
during preloading.

See Info node `(elisp)Advising Functions' for comprehensive documentation.

Toggle minor mode for controlling exposure and editing of text outlines.
\\<allout-mode-map>

Optional prefix argument TOGGLE forces the mode to re-initialize
if it is positive, otherwise it turns the mode off.  Allout
outline mode always runs as a minor mode.

Allout outline mode provides extensive outline oriented formatting and
manipulation.  It enables structural editing of outlines, as well as
navigation and exposure.  It also is specifically aimed at
accommodating syntax-sensitive text like programming languages.  (For
an example, see the allout code itself, which is organized as an allout
outline.)

In addition to typical outline navigation and exposure, allout includes:

 - topic-oriented authoring, including keystroke-based topic creation,
   repositioning, promotion/demotion, cut, and paste
 - incremental search with dynamic exposure and reconcealment of hidden text
 - adjustable format, so programming code can be developed in outline-structure
 - easy topic encryption and decryption
 - \"Hot-spot\" operation, for single-keystroke maneuvering and exposure control
 - integral outline layout, for automatic initial exposure when visiting a file
 - independent extensibility, using comprehensive exposure and authoring hooks

and many other features.

Below is a description of the key bindings, and then explanation of
special `allout-mode' features and terminology.  See also the outline
menubar additions for quick reference to many of the features, and see
the docstring of the function `allout-init' for instructions on
priming your emacs session for automatic activation of `allout-mode'.

The bindings are dictated by the customizable `allout-keybindings-list'
variable.  We recommend customizing `allout-command-prefix' to use just
`\\C-c' as the command prefix, if the allout bindings don't conflict with
any personal bindings you have on \\C-c.  In any case, outline structure
navigation and authoring is simplified by positioning the cursor on an
item's bullet character, the \"hot-spot\" -- then you can invoke allout
commands with just the un-prefixed, un-control-shifted command letters.
This is described further in the HOT-SPOT Operation section.

        Exposure Control:
        ----------------

                  Topic Encryption

Outline mode supports gpg encryption of topics, with support for
symmetric and key-pair modes, passphrase timeout, passphrase
consistency checking, user-provided hinting for symmetric key
mode, and auto-encryption of topics pending encryption on save.

Topics pending encryption are, by default, automatically
encrypted during file saves.  If the contents of the topic
containing the cursor was encrypted for a save, it is
automatically decrypted for continued editing.

The aim of these measures is reliable topic privacy while
preventing accidents like neglected encryption before saves,
forgetting which passphrase was used, and other practical
pitfalls.

See `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption' function docstring
and `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' customization variable
for details.

                 HOT-SPOT Operation

Hot-spot operation provides a means for easy, single-keystroke outline
navigation and exposure control.

When the text cursor is positioned directly on the bullet character of
a topic, regular characters (a to z) invoke the commands of the
corresponding allout-mode keymap control chars.  For example, \"f\"
would invoke the command typically bound to \"C-c<space>C-f\"
\(\\[allout-forward-current-level] `allout-forward-current-level').

Thus, by positioning the cursor on a topic bullet, you can
execute the outline navigation and manipulation commands with a
single keystroke.  Regular navigation keys (eg, \\[forward-char], \\[next-line]) don't get
this special translation, so you can use them to get out of the
hot-spot and back to normal editing operation.

In allout-mode, the normal beginning-of-line command (\\[allout-beginning-of-line]]) is
replaced with one that makes it easy to get to the hot-spot.  If you
repeat it immediately it cycles (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles'
is set) to the beginning of the item and then, if you hit it again
immediately, to the hot-spot.  Similarly, `allout-beginning-of-current-entry'
\(\\[allout-beginning-of-current-entry]) moves to the hot-spot when the cursor is already located
at the beginning of the current entry.

                             Extending Allout

Allout exposure and authoring activites all have associated
hooks, by which independent code can cooperate with allout
without changes to the allout core.  Here are key ones:

`allout-mode-hook'
`allout-mode-deactivate-hook'
`allout-exposure-change-hook'
`allout-structure-added-hook'
`allout-structure-deleted-hook'
`allout-structure-shifted-hook'

                            Terminology

Topic hierarchy constituents -- TOPICS and SUBTOPICS:

ITEM:   A unitary outline element, including the HEADER and ENTRY text.
TOPIC:  An ITEM and any ITEMs contained within it, ie having greater DEPTH
        and with no intervening items of lower DEPTH than the container.
CURRENT ITEM:
        The visible ITEM most immediately containing the cursor.
DEPTH:  The degree of nesting of an ITEM; it increases with containment.
        The DEPTH is determined by the HEADER PREFIX.  The DEPTH is also
        called the:
LEVEL:  The same as DEPTH.

ANCESTORS:
        Those ITEMs whose TOPICs contain an ITEM.
PARENT: An ITEM's immediate ANCESTOR.  It has a DEPTH one less than that
        of the ITEM.
OFFSPRING:
        The ITEMs contained within an ITEM's TOPIC.
SUBTOPIC:
        An OFFSPRING of its ANCESTOR TOPICs.
CHILD:
        An immediate SUBTOPIC of its PARENT.
SIBLINGS:
        TOPICs having the same PARENT and DEPTH.

Topic text constituents:

HEADER: The first line of an ITEM, include the ITEM PREFIX and HEADER
        text.
ENTRY:  The text content of an ITEM, before any OFFSPRING, but including
        the HEADER text and distinct from the ITEM PREFIX.
BODY:   Same as ENTRY.
PREFIX: The leading text of an ITEM which distinguishes it from normal
        ENTRY text.  Allout recognizes the outline structure according
        to the strict PREFIX format.  It consists of a PREFIX-LEAD string,
        PREFIX-PADDING, and a BULLET.  The BULLET might be followed by a
        number, indicating the ordinal number of the topic among its
        siblings, or an asterisk indicating encryption, plus an optional
        space.  After that is the ITEM HEADER text, which is not part of
        the PREFIX.

        The relative length of the PREFIX determines the nesting DEPTH
        of the ITEM.
PREFIX-LEAD:
        The string at the beginning of a HEADER PREFIX, by default a `.'.
        It can be customized by changing the setting of
        `allout-header-prefix' and then reinitializing `allout-mode'.

        When the PREFIX-LEAD is set to the comment-string of a
        programming language, outline structuring can be embedded in
        program code without interfering with processing of the text
        (by emacs or the language processor) as program code.  This
        setting happens automatically when allout mode is used in
        programming-mode buffers.  See `allout-use-mode-specific-leader'
        docstring for more detail.
PREFIX-PADDING:
        Spaces or asterisks which separate the PREFIX-LEAD and the
        bullet, determining the ITEM's DEPTH.
BULLET: A character at the end of the ITEM PREFIX, it must be one of
        the characters listed on `allout-plain-bullets-string' or
        `allout-distinctive-bullets-string'.  When creating a TOPIC,
        plain BULLETs are by default used, according to the DEPTH of the
        TOPIC.  Choice among the distinctive BULLETs is offered when you
        provide a universal argugment (\\[universal-argument]) to the
        TOPIC creation command, or when explictly rebulleting a TOPIC.  The
        significance of the various distinctive bullets is purely by
        convention.  See the documentation for the above bullet strings for
        more details.
EXPOSURE:
        The state of a TOPIC which determines the on-screen visibility
        of its OFFSPRING and contained ENTRY text.
CONCEALED:
        TOPICs and ENTRY text whose EXPOSURE is inhibited.  Concealed
        text is represented by \"...\" ellipses.

        CONCEALED TOPICs are effectively collapsed within an ANCESTOR.
CLOSED: A TOPIC whose immediate OFFSPRING and body-text is CONCEALED.
OPEN:	A TOPIC that is not CLOSED, though its OFFSPRING or BODY may be.

Major mode for editing arrays.

  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.

  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.

  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable `array-respect-tabs' to non-nil will prevent TAB conversion,
but will cause many functions to give errors if they encounter one.

  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local to the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:

Variables you assign:
     array-max-row:          The number of rows in the array.
     array-max-column:       The number of columns in the array.
     array-columns-per-line: The number of columns in the array per line of buffer.
     array-field-width:      The width of each field, in characters.
     array-rows-numbered:    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                       row numbers in the buffer.

Variables which are calculated:
     array-line-length:      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     array-lines-per-row:    The number of buffer lines used to display each row.

  The following commands are available (an asterisk indicates it may
take a numeric prefix argument):

    *  	\\<array-mode-map>\\[array-forward-column]	  Move forward one column.
    *  	\\[array-backward-column]	  Move backward one column.
    *  	\\[array-next-row]	  Move down one row.
    *  	\\[array-previous-row]	  Move up one row.

    *   \\[array-copy-forward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the right.
    *   \\[array-copy-backward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-down]	  Copy the current field into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-up]	  Copy the current field into the row above.

    *   \\[array-copy-column-forward]   Copy the current column into the column to the right.
    *   \\[array-copy-column-backward]   Copy the current column into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-down]   Copy the current row into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-up]   Copy the current row into the row above.

        \\[array-fill-rectangle]   Copy the field at mark into every cell with row and column
                  between that of point and mark.

	\\[array-what-position]	  Display the current array row and column.
	\\[array-goto-cell]	  Go to a particular array cell.

	\\[array-make-template]	  Make a template for a new array.
	\\[array-reconfigure-rows]	  Reconfigure the array.

		  poly-lines.

		* See thru for text means that text already in the buffer
		  will be visible through blanks in the text rendered, while
		  overwrite means the opposite.

		* Vaporizing connected lines only vaporizes lines whose
		  _endpoints_ are connected. See also the variable
		  `artist-vaporize-fuzziness'.

		* Cut copies, then clears the rectangle/square.

		* When drawing lines or poly-lines, you can set arrows.
		  See below under ``Arrows'' for more info.

		* The mode line shows the currently selected drawing operation.
		  In addition, if it has an asterisk (*) at the end, you
		  are currently drawing something.

		* Be patient when flood-filling -- large areas take quite
		  some time to fill.


 mouse-3	Erases character under pointer

General information on working with BibTeX mode:

Use commands such as \\[bibtex-Book] to get a template for a specific entry.
Then fill in all desired fields using \\[bibtex-next-field] to jump from field
to field.  After having filled in all desired fields in the entry, clean the
new entry with the command \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting the variable
`bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries' to non-nil.  However, then BibTeX mode
works only with buffers containing valid (syntactical correct) and sorted
entries.  This is usually the case, if you have created a buffer completely
with BibTeX mode and finished every new entry with \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

For third party BibTeX files, call the command \\[bibtex-convert-alien]
to fully take advantage of all features of BibTeX mode.


Special information:

A command such as \\[bibtex-Book] outlines the fields for a BibTeX book entry.

The names of optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored
by BibTeX.  The names of alternative fields from which only one is required
start with the string ALT.  The OPT or ALT string may be removed from
the name of a field with \\[bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT].
\\[bibtex-make-field] inserts a new field after the current one.
\\[bibtex-kill-field] kills the current field entirely.
\\[bibtex-yank] yanks the last recently killed field after the current field.
\\[bibtex-remove-delimiters] removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
\\[bibtex-empty-field] replaces the text of the current field with the default \"\" or {}.
\\[bibtex-find-text] moves point to the end of the current field.
\\[bibtex-complete] completes word fragment before point according to context.

The command \\[bibtex-clean-entry] cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from the names of all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that
no required fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value
of `bibtex-entry-format'.  Furthermore, it can automatically generate a key
for the BibTeX entry, see `bibtex-generate-autokey'.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from `bibtex-entry-format'.

BibTeX mode supports Imenu and hideshow minor mode (`hs-minor-mode').

Play blackbox.
Optional prefix argument is the number of balls; the default is 4.

What is blackbox?

Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.

Overview of play:

\\<blackbox-mode-map>To play blackbox, type \\[blackbox].  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.

The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.

To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.

You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing \\[bb-romp].

When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press \\[bb-done].  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.

Details:

There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:

	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.

	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.

	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.

The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.

As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under \"Detour\" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.

Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.

In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.

A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -

Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection.

List of notable days for the command \\[holidays].

Additional holidays are easy to add to the list, just put them in the
list `holiday-other-holidays' in your .emacs file.  Similarly, by setting
any of `holiday-general-holidays', `holiday-local-holidays',
`holiday-christian-holidays', `holiday-hebrew-holidays',
`holiday-islamic-holidays', `holiday-bahai-holidays',
`holiday-oriental-holidays', or `holiday-solar-holidays' to nil in your
.emacs file, you can eliminate unwanted categories of holidays.

The aforementioned variables control the holiday choices offered
by the function `holiday-list' when it is called interactively.

They also initialize the default value of `calendar-holidays',
which is the default list of holidays used by the function
`holiday-list' in the non-interactive case.  Note that these
variables have no effect on `calendar-holidays' after it has been
set (e.g. after the calendar is loaded).  In that case, customize
`calendar-holidays' directly.

The intention is that (in the US) `holiday-local-holidays' be set in
site-init.el and `holiday-other-holidays' be set by the user.

Entries on the list are expressions that return (possibly empty) lists of
items of the form ((month day year) string) of a holiday in the
three-month period centered around `displayed-month' of `displayed-year'.
Several basic functions are provided for this purpose:

    (holiday-fixed MONTH DAY STRING) is a fixed date on the Gregorian calendar
    (holiday-float MONTH DAYNAME K STRING &optional day) is the Kth DAYNAME in
                               MONTH on the Gregorian calendar (0 for Sunday,
                               etc.); K<0 means count back from the end of the
                               month.  An optional parameter DAY means the Kth
                               DAYNAME after/before MONTH DAY.
    (holiday-hebrew MONTH DAY STRING)  a fixed date on the Hebrew calendar
    (holiday-islamic MONTH DAY STRING) a fixed date on the Islamic calendar
    (holiday-bahai MONTH DAY STRING)   a fixed date on the Baha'i calendar
    (holiday-julian MONTH DAY STRING)  a fixed date on the Julian calendar
    (holiday-sexp SEXP STRING) SEXP is a Gregorian-date-valued expression
                               in the variable `year'; if it evaluates to
                               a visible date, that's the holiday; if it
                               evaluates to nil, there's no holiday.  STRING
                               is an expression in the variable `date'.

For example, to add Bastille Day, celebrated in France on July 14, add

     (holiday-fixed 7 14 \"Bastille Day\")

to the list.  To add Hurricane Supplication Day, celebrated in the Virgin
Islands on the fourth Monday in August, add

     (holiday-float 8 1 4 \"Hurricane Supplication Day\")

to the list (the last Monday would be specified with `-1' instead of `4').
To add the last day of Hanukkah to the list, use

     (holiday-hebrew 10 2 \"Last day of Hanukkah\")

since the Hebrew months are numbered with 1 starting from Nisan.
To add the Islamic feast celebrating Mohammed's birthday, use

     (holiday-islamic 3 12 \"Mohammed's Birthday\")

since the Islamic months are numbered from 1 starting with Muharram.
To add an entry for the Baha'i festival of Ridvan, use

     (holiday-bahai 2 13 \"Festival of Ridvan\")

since the Baha'i months are numbered from 1 starting with Baha.
To add Thomas Jefferson's birthday, April 2, 1743 (Julian), use

     (holiday-julian 4 2 \"Jefferson's Birthday\")

To include a holiday conditionally, use the sexp form or a conditional.  For
example, to include American presidential elections, which occur on the first
Tuesday after the first Monday in November of years divisible by 4, add

     (holiday-sexp
       '(if (zerop (% year 4))
           (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
             (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before
                   1 (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                            (list 11 1 year)))))))
       \"US Presidential Election\")

or

     (if (zerop (% displayed-year 4))
         (holiday-fixed 11
                (calendar-extract-day
                 (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
                  (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before
                       1 (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                               (list 11 1 displayed-year)))))))
                \"US Presidential Election\"))

to the list.  To include the phases of the moon, add

     (lunar-phases)

to the holiday list, where `lunar-phases' is an Emacs-Lisp function that
you've written to return a (possibly empty) list of the relevant VISIBLE dates
with descriptive strings such as

     (((2 6 1989) \"New Moon\") ((2 12 1989) \"First Quarter Moon\") ... ).")

Display a three-month Gregorian calendar.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in
the middle surrounded by the previous and next months.  The
cursor is put on today's date.  If optional prefix argument ARG
is non-nil, prompts for the central month and year.

Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved
into view.  Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar
can be scrolled forward or backward.  The cursor can be moved
forward or backward by one day, one week, one month, or one year.
All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the
digit keys and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  Use
\\[describe-mode] for details of the key bindings in the calendar
window.

Displays the calendar in a separate window, or optionally in a
separate frame, depending on the value of `calendar-setup'.

If `calendar-view-diary-initially-flag' is non-nil, also displays the
diary entries for the current date (or however many days
`diary-number-of-entries' specifies).  This variable can be
overridden by `calendar-setup'.  As well as being displayed,
diary entries can also be marked on the calendar (see
`calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag').

Runs the following hooks:

`calendar-load-hook' - after loading calendar.el
`calendar-today-visible-hook', `calendar-today-invisible-hook' - after
   generating a calendar, if today's date is visible or not, respectively
`calendar-initial-window-hook' - after first creating a calendar

In this minor mode, a word boundary occurs immediately before an
uppercase letter in a symbol.  This is in addition to all the normal
boundaries given by the syntax and category tables.  There is no
restriction to ASCII.

E.g. the beginning of words in the following identifier are as marked:

  capitalizedWorDD
  ^          ^  ^^

Note that these word boundaries only apply for word motion and
marking commands such as \\[forward-word].  This mode does not affect word
boundaries in found by regexp matching (`\\>', `\\w' &c).

This style of identifiers is common in environments like Java ones,
where underscores aren't trendy enough.  Capitalization rules are
sometimes part of the language, e.g. Haskell, which may thus encourage
such a style.  It is appropriate to add `capitalized-words-mode' to
the mode hook for programming langauge modes in which you encounter
variables like this, e.g. `java-mode-hook'.  It's unlikely to cause
trouble if such identifiers aren't used.

BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION is an integer value specifying the approximate
output buffer magnification size compared with the bytes of input data
text.  It is assured that the actual output buffer has 256 bytes
more than the size calculated by BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION.
If the value is zero, the CCL program can't execute `read' and

executed at first.  If there's no more input data when `read' command
is executed in CCL_MAIN_CODE, CCL_EOF_CODE is executed.  If
CCL_MAIN_CODE is terminated, CCL_EOF_CODE is not executed.

Mode for Unix and Windows Conf files and Java properties.
Most conf files know only three kinds of constructs: parameter
assignments optionally grouped into sections and comments.  Yet
there is a great range of variation in the exact syntax of conf
files.  See below for various wrapper commands that set up the
details for some of the most widespread variants.

This mode sets up font locking, outline, imenu and it provides
alignment support through `conf-align-assignments'.  If strings
come out wrong, try `conf-quote-normal'.

Some files allow continuation lines, either with a backslash at
the end of line, or by indenting the next line (further).  These
constructs cannot currently be recognized.

Because of this great variety of nuances, which are often not
even clearly specified, please don't expect it to get every file
quite right.  Patches that clearly identify some special case,
without breaking the general ones, are welcome.

If instead you start this mode with the generic `conf-mode'
command, it will parse the buffer.  It will generally well
identify the first four cases listed below.  If the buffer

Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Various characters in Perl almost always come in pairs: {}, (), [],
sometimes <>.  When the user types the first, she gets the second as
well, with optional special formatting done on {}.  (Disabled by
default.)  You can always quote (with \\[quoted-insert]) the left
\"paren\" to avoid the expansion.  The processing of < is special,
since most the time you mean \"less\".  CPerl mode tries to guess
whether you want to type pair <>, and inserts is if it
appropriate.  You can set `cperl-electric-parens-string' to the string that
contains the parenths from the above list you want to be electrical.
Electricity of parenths is controlled by `cperl-electric-parens'.
You may also set `cperl-electric-parens-mark' to have electric parens
look for active mark and \"embrace\" a region if possible.'

CPerl mode provides expansion of the Perl control constructs:

   if, else, elsif, unless, while, until, continue, do,
   for, foreach, formy and foreachmy.

and POD directives (Disabled by default, see `cperl-electric-keywords'.)

The user types the keyword immediately followed by a space, which
causes the construct to be expanded, and the point is positioned where
she is most likely to want to be.  eg. when the user types a space
following \"if\" the following appears in the buffer: if () { or if ()
} { } and the cursor is between the parentheses.  The user can then
type some boolean expression within the parens.  Having done that,
typing \\[cperl-linefeed] places you - appropriately indented - on a
new line between the braces (if you typed \\[cperl-linefeed] in a POD
directive line, then appropriate number of new lines is inserted).

If CPerl decides that you want to insert \"English\" style construct like

            bite if angry;

it will not do any expansion.  See also help on variable
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'.  (Note that one can switch the
help message on expansion by setting `cperl-message-electric-keyword'
to nil.)

\\[cperl-linefeed] is a convenience replacement for typing carriage
return.  It places you in the next line with proper indentation, or if
you type it inside the inline block of control construct, like

            foreach (@lines) {print; print}

and you are on a boundary of a statement inside braces, it will
transform the construct into a multiline and will place you into an
appropriately indented blank line.  If you need a usual
`newline-and-indent' behavior, it is on \\[newline-and-indent],
see documentation on `cperl-electric-linefeed'.

Use \\[cperl-invert-if-unless] to change a construction of the form

	    if (A) { B }

into

            B if A;

\\{cperl-mode-map}

Setting the variable `cperl-font-lock' to t switches on font-lock-mode
\(even with older Emacsen), `cperl-electric-lbrace-space' to t switches
on electric space between $ and {, `cperl-electric-parens-string' is
the string that contains parentheses that should be electric in CPerl
\(see also `cperl-electric-parens-mark' and `cperl-electric-parens'),
setting `cperl-electric-keywords' enables electric expansion of
control structures in CPerl.  `cperl-electric-linefeed' governs which
one of two linefeed behavior is preferable.  You can enable all these
options simultaneously (recommended mode of use) by setting
`cperl-hairy' to t.  In this case you can switch separate options off
by setting them to `null'.  Note that one may undo the extra
whitespace inserted by semis and braces in `auto-newline'-mode by
consequent \\[cperl-electric-backspace].

If your site has perl5 documentation in info format, you can use commands
\\[cperl-info-on-current-command] and \\[cperl-info-on-command] to access it.
These keys run commands `cperl-info-on-current-command' and
`cperl-info-on-command', which one is which is controlled by variable
`cperl-info-on-command-no-prompt' and `cperl-clobber-lisp-bindings'
\(in turn affected by `cperl-hairy').

Even if you have no info-format documentation, short one-liner-style
help is available on \\[cperl-get-help], and one can run perldoc or
man via menu.

It is possible to show this help automatically after some idle time.
This is regulated by variable `cperl-lazy-help-time'.  Default with
`cperl-hairy' (if the value of `cperl-lazy-help-time' is nil) is 5
secs idle time .  It is also possible to switch this on/off from the
menu, or via \\[cperl-toggle-autohelp].  Requires `run-with-idle-timer'.

Use \\[cperl-lineup] to vertically lineup some construction - put the
beginning of the region at the start of construction, and make region
span the needed amount of lines.

Variables `cperl-pod-here-scan', `cperl-pod-here-fontify',
`cperl-pod-face', `cperl-pod-head-face' control processing of POD and
here-docs sections.  With capable Emaxen results of scan are used
for indentation too, otherwise they are used for highlighting only.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `cperl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in CPerl mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `cperl-indent-left-aligned-comments'
    Non-nil means that the comment starting in leftmost column should indent.
 `cperl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in Perl code.  The following
    \\[cperl-electric-backspace] will remove the inserted whitespace.
    Insertion after colons requires both this variable and
    `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon' set.
 `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon'
    Non-nil means automatically newline even after colons.
    Subject to `cperl-auto-newline' setting.
 `cperl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `cperl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if, or body of a while, or just a statement continuation.
 `cperl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `cperl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `cperl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `cperl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it the line started
    this far to the right of the actual line indentation.
 `cperl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `cperl-min-label-indent'
    Minimal indentation for line that is a label.

Settings for classic indent-styles: K&R BSD=C++ GNU PerlStyle=Whitesmith
  `cperl-indent-level'                5   4       2   4
  `cperl-brace-offset'                0   0       0   0

  `cperl-continued-statement-offset'  5   4       2   4

CPerl knows several indentation styles, and may bulk set the
corresponding variables.  Use \\[cperl-set-style] to do this.  Use
\\[cperl-set-style-back] to restore the memorized preexisting values
\(both available from menu).  See examples in `cperl-style-examples'.

Part of the indentation style is how different parts of if/elsif/else
statements are broken into lines; in CPerl, this is reflected on how
templates for these constructs are created (controlled by
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'), and how reflow-logic should treat \"continuation\" blocks of else/elsif/continue, controlled by the same variable,
and by `cperl-extra-newline-before-brace-multiline',
`cperl-merge-trailing-else', `cperl-indent-region-fix-constructs'.

If `cperl-indent-level' is 0, the statement after opening brace in
column 0 is indented on
`cperl-brace-offset'+`cperl-continued-statement-offset'.

Turning on CPerl mode calls the hooks in the variable `cperl-mode-hook'
with no args.

DO NOT FORGET to read micro-docs (available from `Perl' menu)
or as help on variables `cperl-tips', `cperl-problems',
`cperl-praise', `cperl-speed'.

Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion.
By using this functionality, a user may specify multiple strings at a
single prompt, optionally using completion.

Multiple strings are specified by separating each of the strings with
a prespecified separator character.  For example, if the separator
character is a comma, the strings 'alice', 'bob', and 'eve' would be
specified as 'alice,bob,eve'.

The default value for the separator character is the value of
`crm-default-separator' (comma).  The separator character may be
changed by modifying the value of `crm-separator'.

Contiguous strings of non-separator-characters are referred to as
'elements'.  In the aforementioned example, the elements are: 'alice',
'bob', and 'eve'.

Completion is available on a per-element basis.  For example, if the
contents of the minibuffer are 'alice,bob,eve' and point is between
'l' and 'i', pressing TAB operates on the element 'alice'.

The return value of this function is a list of the read strings.

PACKAGE come one or more elements, each associating a

EVERSION in which it (or a subsequent version of PACKAGE)
was first released.  Both PVERSION and EVERSION are strings.
PVERSION should be a string that this package used in
the :package-version keyword for `defcustom', `defgroup',

The default is nil, which means to use your init file

You can set this option through Custom, if you carefully read the
last paragraph below.  However, usually it is simpler to write
something like the following in your init file:

\(setq custom-file \"~/.emacs-custom.el\")
\(load custom-file)

Note that both lines are necessary: the first line tells Custom to
save all customizations in this file, but does not load it.

When you change this variable outside Custom, look in the
previous custom file (usually your init file) for the
forms `(custom-set-variables ...)'  and `(custom-set-faces ...)',
and copy them (whichever ones you find) to the new custom file.
This will preserve your existing customizations.

If you save this option using Custom, Custom will write all
currently saved customizations, including the new one for this
option itself, into the file you specify, overwriting any
`custom-set-variables' and `custom-set-faces' forms already
present in that file.  It will not delete any customizations from
the old custom file.  You should do that manually if that is what you
want.  You also have to put something like `(load \"CUSTOM-FILE\")

Labels are indented to a fixed position unless they begin or end a block.

Variables controlling indentation style and extra features:

 dcl-basic-offset
    Extra indentation within blocks.

 dcl-continuation-offset
    Extra indentation for continued lines.

 dcl-margin-offset
    Indentation for the first command line in a file or SUBROUTINE.

 dcl-margin-label-offset
    Indentation for a label.

 dcl-comment-line-regexp
    Lines matching this regexp will not be indented.

 dcl-block-begin-regexp
 dcl-block-end-regexp
    Regexps that match command lines that begin and end, respectively,
    a block of commmand lines that will be given extra indentation.

	dcl-calc-command-indent-multiple
	dcl-calc-command-indent-hang

 dcl-calc-cont-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for continued lines.
    One such function is included in the package:
	dcl-calc-cont-indent-relative    (set by default)

 dcl-tab-always-indent
    If t, pressing TAB always indents the current line.
    If nil, pressing TAB indents the current line if point is at the left
    margin.

 dcl-electric-characters
    Non-nil causes lines to be indented at once when a label, ELSE or ENDIF is
    typed.

 dcl-electric-reindent-regexps
    Use this variable and function dcl-electric-character to customize
    which words trigger electric indentation.

 dcl-tempo-comma
 dcl-tempo-left-paren
 dcl-tempo-right-paren
    These variables control the look of expanded templates.

 dcl-imenu-generic-expression
    Default value for imenu-generic-expression.  The default includes
    SUBROUTINE labels in the main listing and sub-listings for
    other labels, CALL, GOTO and GOSUB statements.

 dcl-imenu-label-labels
 dcl-imenu-label-goto
 dcl-imenu-label-gosub
 dcl-imenu-label-call
    Change the text that is used as sub-listing labels in imenu.

Loading this package calls the value of the variable
`dcl-mode-load-hook' with no args, if that value is non-nil.
Turning on DCL mode calls the value of the variable `dcl-mode-hook'

The following example uses the default values for all variables:

$! dcl-comment-line-regexp)
$! Next follows the first command line.  It is indented dcl-margin-offset.
$       i = 1

$       then
$           ! Lines between THEN-ELSE and ELSE-ENDIF are
$           ! indented dcl-basic-offset
$           loop1: ! This matches dcl-block-begin-regexp...
$               ! ...so this line is indented dcl-basic-offset
$               text = \"This \" + - ! is a continued line
                       \"lined up with the command line\"

Data lines are not indented at all.

Optional INIT-VALUE is the initial value of the mode's variable.
Optional LIGHTER is displayed in the modeline when the mode is on.
Optional KEYMAP is the default (defvar) keymap bound to the mode keymap.
  If it is a list, it is passed to `easy-mmode-define-keymap'

BODY contains code to execute each time the mode is activated or deactivated.
  It is executed after toggling the mode,
  and before running the hook variable `MODE-hook'.
  Before the actual body code, you can write keyword arguments (alternating
  keywords and values).  These following keyword arguments are supported (other
  keywords will be passed to `defcustom' if the minor mode is global):
:group GROUP	Custom group name to use in all generated `defcustom' forms.
		Defaults to MODE without the possible trailing \"-mode\".
		Don't use this default group name unless you have written a
		`defgroup' to define that group properly.
:global GLOBAL	If non-nil specifies that the minor mode is not meant to be
		buffer-local, so don't make the variable MODE buffer-local.
		By default, the mode is buffer-local.
:init-value VAL	Same as the INIT-VALUE argument.
:lighter SPEC	Same as the LIGHTER argument.
:keymap MAP	Same as the KEYMAP argument.
:require SYM	Same as in `defcustom'.

For example, you could write
  (define-minor-mode foo-mode \"If enabled, foo on you!\"

If SYMBOL is nil, just store the menu keymap into MAPS.

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar item name.
It may be followed by the following keyword argument pairs

   :filter FUNCTION

FUNCTION is a function with one argument, the rest of menu items.
It returns the remaining items of the displayed menu.

   :visible INCLUDE

INCLUDE is an expression; this menu is only visible if this
expression has a non-nil value.  `:included' is an alias for `:visible'.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the menu is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

The rest of the elements in MENU, are menu items.

A menu item is usually a vector of three elements:  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen,
or a list to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

Alternatively, a menu item may have the form:

   [ NAME CALLBACK [ KEYWORD ARG ] ... ]

Where KEYWORD is one of the symbols defined below.

   :keys KEYS

KEYS is a string; a complex keyboard equivalent to this menu item.
This is normally not needed because keyboard equivalents are usually
computed automatically.
KEYS is expanded with `substitute-command-keys' before it is used.

   :key-sequence KEYS

KEYS is nil, a string or a vector; nil or a keyboard equivalent to this
menu item.
This is a hint that will considerably speed up Emacs' first display of
a menu.  Use `:key-sequence nil' when you know that this menu item has no
keyboard equivalent.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :visible INCLUDE

INCLUDE is an expression; this item is only visible if this
expression has a non-nil value.  `:included' is an alias for `:visible'.

   :label FORM

FORM is an expression that will be dynamically evaluated and whose
value will be used for the menu entry's text label (the default is NAME).

   :suffix FORM

FORM is an expression that will be dynamically evaluated and whose
value will be concatenated to the menu entry's label.

   :style STYLE

STYLE is a symbol describing the type of menu item.  The following are
defined:

toggle: A checkbox.
        Prepend the name with `(*) ' or `( ) ' depending on if selected or not.
radio: A radio button.
       Prepend the name with `[X] ' or `[ ] ' depending on if selected or not.
button: Surround the name with `[' and `]'.  Use this for an item in the
        menu bar itself.
anything else means an ordinary menu item.

   :selected SELECTED

SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is selected
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :help HELP

HELP is a string, the help to display for the menu item.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list with the same format as MENU.  This is a submenu.

Minor mode that combines windows into one tall virtual window.

The feeling of a \"virtual window\" has been accomplished by the use
of two major techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)

* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one.  Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\\[split-window-horizontally]' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.

If the variable `follow-intercept-processes' is non-nil, Follow mode
will listen to the output of processes and redisplay accordingly.
\(This is the default.)

This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.

Keys specific to Follow mode:
\\{follow-mode-map}

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)

(autoload 'follow-delete-other-windows-and-split "follow" "\
Create two side by side windows and enter Follow mode.

Execute this command to display as much as possible of the text

frame, are deleted and the selected window is split in two
side-by-side windows.  Follow mode is activated, hence the
two windows always will display two successive pages.
\(If one window is moved, the other one will follow.)

If ARG is positive, the leftmost window is selected.  If negative,
the rightmost is selected.  If ARG is nil, the leftmost window is
selected if the original window is the first one in the frame.

To bind this command to a hotkey, place the following line

MODE is the name of the command for the generic mode; don't quote it.

COMMENT-LIST is a list in which each element is either a character, a
string of one or two characters, or a cons cell.  A character or a
string is set up in the mode's syntax table as a \"comment starter\".
If the entry is a cons cell, the `car' is set up as a \"comment
starter\" and the `cdr' as a \"comment ender\".  (Use nil for the
latter if you want comments to end at the end of the line.)  Note that
the syntax table has limitations about what comment starters and
enders are actually possible.

KEYWORD-LIST is a list of keywords to highlight with
`font-lock-keyword-face'.  Each keyword should be a string.

FONT-LOCK-LIST is a list of additional expressions to highlight.  Each
element of this list should have the same form as an element of
`font-lock-keywords'.

AUTO-MODE-LIST is a list of regular expressions to add to
`auto-mode-alist'.  These regular expressions are added when Emacs
runs the macro expansion.

FUNCTION-LIST is a list of functions to call to do some additional
setup.  The mode command calls these functions just before it runs the
mode hook `MODE-hook'.

For each selected group, a SPLIT is composed like this: if SPLIT-SPEC

\\<hexl-mode-map>A mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.
This is not an ordinary major mode; it alters some aspects
of the current mode's behavior, but not all; also, you can exit
Hexl mode and return to the previous mode using `hexl-mode-exit'.

This function automatically converts a buffer into the hexl format
using the function `hexlify-buffer'.

Each line in the buffer has an \"address\" (displayed in hexadecimal)
representing the offset into the file that the characters on this line
are at and 16 characters from the file (displayed as hexadecimal
values grouped every 16 bits) and as their ASCII values.

If any of the characters (displayed as ASCII characters) are
unprintable (control or meta characters) they will be replaced as
periods.

If `hexl-mode' is invoked with an argument the buffer is assumed to be
in hexl format.

A sample format:

  HEX ADDR: 0001 0203 0405 0607 0809 0a0b 0c0d 0e0f     ASCII-TEXT
  --------  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----  ----------------

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal Emacs text buffer.  Most
cursor movement bindings are the same (ie. Use \\[hexl-backward-char], \\[hexl-forward-char], \\[hexl-next-line], and \\[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up).

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \\[hexl-beginning-of-line], \\[hexl-end-of-line], \\[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \\[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.

\\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit hexl-mode.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \\[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in Hexl mode.

\\[describe-bindings] for advanced commands.

When hi-lock is turned on, a \"Regexp Highlighting\" submenu is added

  be read the next time file is loaded or when the \\[hi-lock-find-patterns] command

rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the

;;; Generated autoloads from progmodes/idlwave.el

(autoload 'idlwave-mode "idlwave" "\
Major mode for editing IDL source files (version 6.1_em22).

The main features of this mode are

1. Indentation and Formatting
   --------------------------
   Like other Emacs programming modes, C-j inserts a newline and indents.
   TAB is used for explicit indentation of the current line.

   To start a continuation line, use \\[idlwave-split-line].  This
   function can also be used in the middle of a line to split the line
   at that point.  When used inside a long constant string, the string
   is split at that point with the `+' concatenation operator.

   Comments are indented as follows:

   `;;;' Indentation remains unchanged.
   `;;'  Indent like the surrounding code
   `;'   Indent to a minimum column.

   The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.

   Use \\[idlwave-fill-paragraph] to refill a paragraph inside a
   comment.  The indentation of the second line of the paragraph
   relative to the first will be retained.  Use
   \\[idlwave-auto-fill-mode] to toggle auto-fill mode for these
   comments.  When the variable `idlwave-fill-comment-line-only' is
   nil, code can also be auto-filled and auto-indented.

   To convert pre-existing IDL code to your formatting style, mark the
   entire buffer with \\[mark-whole-buffer] and execute
   \\[idlwave-expand-region-abbrevs].  Then mark the entire buffer
   again followed by \\[indent-region] (`indent-region').

2. Routine Info
   ------------
   IDLWAVE displays information about the calling sequence and the
   accepted keyword parameters of a procedure or function with
   \\[idlwave-routine-info].  \\[idlwave-find-module] jumps to the
   source file of a module.  These commands know about system
   routines, all routines in idlwave-mode buffers and (when the
   idlwave-shell is active) about all modules currently compiled under
   this shell.  It also makes use of pre-compiled or custom-scanned
   user and library catalogs many popular libraries ship with by
   default.  Use \\[idlwave-update-routine-info] to update this
   information, which is also used for completion (see item 4).

3. Online IDL Help
   ---------------

   \\[idlwave-context-help] displays the IDL documentation relevant
   for the system variable, keyword, or routines at point.  A single
   key stroke gets you directly to the right place in the docs.  See
   the manual to configure where and how the HTML help is displayed.

4. Completion
   ----------
   \\[idlwave-complete] completes the names of procedures, functions
   class names, keyword parameters, system variables and tags, class
   tags, structure tags, filenames and much more.  It is context
   sensitive and figures out what is expected at point.  Lower case
   strings are completed in lower case, other strings in mixed or
   upper case.

5. Code Templates and Abbreviations
   --------------------------------
   Many Abbreviations are predefined to expand to code fragments and templates.
   The abbreviations start generally with a `\\`.  Some examples

   \\pr        PROCEDURE template
   \\fu        FUNCTION template
   \\c         CASE statement template
   \\sw        SWITCH statement template
   \\f         FOR loop template
   \\r         REPEAT Loop template
   \\w         WHILE loop template
   \\i         IF statement template
   \\elif      IF-ELSE statement template
   \\b         BEGIN

   For a full list, use \\[idlwave-list-abbrevs].  Some templates also
   have direct keybindings - see the list of keybindings below.

   \\[idlwave-doc-header] inserts a documentation header at the
   beginning of the current program unit (pro, function or main).
   Change log entries can be added to the current program unit with
   \\[idlwave-doc-modification].

6. Automatic Case Conversion
   -------------------------
   The case of reserved words and some abbrevs is controlled by
   `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase' and `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.

7. Automatic END completion
   ------------------------
   If the variable `idlwave-expand-generic-end' is non-nil, each END typed
   will be converted to the specific version, like ENDIF, ENDFOR, etc.

8. Hooks
   -----
   Loading idlwave.el runs `idlwave-load-hook'.
   Turning on `idlwave-mode' runs `idlwave-mode-hook'.

9. Documentation and Customization
   -------------------------------
   Info documentation for this package is available.  Use
   \\[idlwave-info] to display (complain to your sysadmin if that does
   not work).  For Postscript, PDF, and HTML versions of the
   documentation, check IDLWAVE's homepage at `http://idlwave.org'.
   IDLWAVE has customize support - see the group `idlwave'.

10.Keybindings
   -----------
   Here is a list of all keybindings of this mode.
   If some of the key bindings below show with ??, use \\[describe-key]
   followed by the key sequence to see what the key sequence does.

\\[Info-next]	Move to the \"next\" node of this node.
\\[Info-prev]	Move to the \"previous\" node of this node.
\\[Info-up]	Move \"up\" from this node.
\\[Info-menu]	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).
	  Picking a menu item causes another node to be selected.
\\[Info-directory]	Go to the Info directory node.
\\[Info-top-node]	Go to the Top node of this file.
\\[Info-final-node]	Go to the final node in this file.

\\[Info-follow-reference]	Follow a cross reference.  Reads name of reference.
\\[Info-history-back]	Move back in history to the last node you were at.
\\[Info-history-forward]	Move forward in history to the node you returned from after using \\[Info-history-back].
\\[Info-history]	Go to menu of visited nodes.
\\[Info-toc]	Go to table of contents of the current Info file.

Moving within a node:
\\[Info-scroll-up]	Normally, scroll forward a full screen.
	  Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the
	  screen but after point, the next scroll moves into its first
	  subnode.  When after all menu items (or if there is no menu),

\\[Info-scroll-down]	Normally, scroll backward.  If the beginning of the buffer is
	  already visible, try to go to the previous menu entry, or up
	  if there is none.
\\[beginning-of-buffer]	Go to beginning of node.

Advanced commands:

	  and select the node in which the next occurrence is found.
\\[Info-search-case-sensitively]	Search through this Info file for specified regexp case-sensitively.
\\[Info-search-next]	Search for another occurrence of regexp

An alist of dictionaries and their associated parameters.

Each element of this list is also a list:

\(DICTIONARY-NAME CASECHARS NOT-CASECHARS OTHERCHARS MANY-OTHERCHARS-P
        ISPELL-ARGS EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE CHARACTER-SET)

DICTIONARY-NAME is a possible string value of variable `ispell-dictionary',
nil means the default dictionary.

CASECHARS is a regular expression of valid characters that comprise a word.

NOT-CASECHARS is the opposite regexp of CASECHARS.

OTHERCHARS is a regexp of characters in the NOT-CASECHARS set but which can be
used to construct words in some special way.  If OTHERCHARS characters follow
and precede characters from CASECHARS, they are parsed as part of a word,
otherwise they become word-breaks.  As an example in English, assume the
regular expression \"[']\" for OTHERCHARS.  Then \"they're\" and
\"Steven's\" are parsed as single words including the \"'\" character, but
\"Stevens'\" does not include the quote character as part of the word.
If you want OTHERCHARS to be empty, use the empty string.
Hint: regexp syntax requires the hyphen to be declared first here.

CASECHARS, NOT-CASECHARS, and OTHERCHARS must be unibyte strings
containing bytes of CHARACTER-SET.  In addition, if they contain
a non-ASCII byte, the regular expression must be a single
`character set' construct that doesn't specify a character range
for non-ASCII bytes.

MANY-OTHERCHARS-P is non-nil when multiple OTHERCHARS are allowed in a word.
Otherwise only a single OTHERCHARS character is allowed to be part of any
single word.

ISPELL-ARGS is a list of additional arguments passed to the ispell
subprocess.

EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE should be used when dictionaries are used which
have been configured in an Ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts
can be encoded as \\\"a, a\\\", \"a, ...)  Defaults are ~tex and ~nroff
in English.  This has the same effect as the command-line `-T' option.
The buffer Major Mode controls Ispell's parsing in tex or nroff mode,
but the dictionary can control the extended character mode.
Both defaults can be overruled in a buffer-local fashion. See
`ispell-parsing-keyword' for details on this.

CHARACTER-SET used for languages with multibyte characters.

Note that the CASECHARS and OTHERCHARS slots of the alist should
contain the same character set as casechars and otherchars in the
LANGUAGE.aff file (e.g., english.aff).")

\\{makefile-mode-map}

In the browser, use the following keys:

\\{makefile-browser-map}

Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:

`makefile-browser-buffer-name':
    Name of the macro- and target browser buffer.

`makefile-target-colon':
    The string that gets appended to all target names
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.
    \":\" or \"::\" are quite common values.

`makefile-macro-assign':
   The string that gets appended to all macro names
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.
   The normal value should be \" = \", since this is what
   standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you
   might prefer to use \" += \" or \" := \" .

`makefile-tab-after-target-colon':
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.

`makefile-browser-leftmost-column':
   Number of blanks to the left of the browser selection mark.

`makefile-browser-cursor-column':
   Column in which the cursor is positioned when it moves
   up or down in the browser.

`makefile-browser-selected-mark':
   String used to mark selected entries in the browser.

`makefile-browser-unselected-mark':
   String used to mark unselected entries in the browser.

`makefile-browser-auto-advance-after-selection-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value the cursor
   will automagically advance to the next line after an item
   has been selected in the browser.

`makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-pickup-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise
   filenames are omitted.

`makefile-cleanup-continuations':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then Makefile mode
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving
   the backslash itself intact.
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes Makefile mode
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when \"it seems necessary\".

`makefile-browser-hook':
   A function or list of functions to be called just before the
   browser is entered. This is executed in the makefile buffer.

`makefile-special-targets-list':
   List of special targets. You will be offered to complete
   on one of those in the minibuffer whenever you enter a `.'.
   at the beginning of a line in Makefile mode.

Ranges
======
Many commands that operate on individual messages, such as
`mh-forward' or `mh-refile-msg' take a RANGE argument. This argument
can be used in several ways.

If you provide the prefix argument (\\[universal-argument]) to
these commands, then you will be prompted for the message range.
This can be any valid MH range which can include messages,
sequences, and the abbreviations (described in the mh(1) man
page):

<num1>-<num2>
    Indicates all messages in the range <num1> to <num2>, inclusive.
    The range must be nonempty.

<num>:N
<num>:+N
<num>:-N
    Up to N messages beginning with (or ending with) message num. Num
    may be any of the predefined symbols: first, prev, cur, next or
    last.

first:N
prev:N
next:N
last:N
    The first, previous, next or last messages, if they exist.

all
    All of the messages.

For example, a range that shows all of these things is `1 2 3
5-10 last:5 unseen'.

If the option `transient-mark-mode' is set to t and you set a
region in the MH-Folder buffer, then the MH-E command will
perform the operation on all messages in that region.

Syntax highlighting is performed unless the variable

\\[nxml-finish-element] finishes the current element by inserting an end-tag.
C-c C-i closes a start-tag with `>' and then inserts a balancing end-tag
leaving point between the start-tag and end-tag. 
\\[nxml-balanced-close-start-tag-block] is similar but for block rather than inline elements:
the start-tag, point, and end-tag are all left on separate lines.
If `nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag' is non-nil, then inserting a `</'
automatically inserts the rest of the end-tag.

\\[nxml-complete] performs completion on the symbol preceding point.

\\[nxml-dynamic-markup-word] uses the contents of the current buffer
to choose a tag to put around the word preceding point.

Sections of the document can be displayed in outline form.  The
variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' controls when an element
is recognized as a section.  The same key sequences that change
visibility in outline mode are used except that they start with C-c C-o
instead of C-c.

Validation is provided by the related minor-mode `rng-validate-mode'.
This also makes completion schema- and context- sensitive.  Element
names, attribute names, attribute values and namespace URIs can all be
completed. By default, `rng-validate-mode' is automatically enabled. You
can toggle it using \\[rng-validate-mode] or change the default by
customizing `rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag'.

\\[indent-for-tab-command] indents the current line appropriately.
This can be customized using the variable `nxml-child-indent'

\\[nxml-insert-named-char] inserts a character reference using
the character's name (by default, the Unicode name). \\[universal-argument] \\[nxml-insert-named-char]
inserts the character directly.

The Emacs commands that normally operate on balanced expressions will
operate on XML markup items.  Thus \\[forward-sexp] will move forward
across one markup item; \\[backward-sexp] will move backward across
one markup item; \\[kill-sexp] will kill the following markup item;

be treated as a single markup item, set the variable
`nxml-sexp-element-flag' to t.  For more details, see the function
`nxml-forward-balanced-item'.

Major mode for editing Octave code.

This mode makes it easier to write Octave code by helping with
indentation, doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev mode) and by
showing keywords, comments, strings, etc.. in different faces (with
Font Lock mode on terminals that support it).

Octave itself is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  Function definitions
can also be stored in files, and it can be used in a batch mode (which
is why you need this mode!).

The latest released version of Octave is always available via anonymous
ftp from ftp.octave.org in the directory `/pub/octave'.  Complete
source and binaries for several popular systems are available.

Type \\[list-abbrevs] to display the built-in abbrevs for Octave keywords.

Keybindings
===========

\\{octave-mode-map}

Variables you can use to customize Octave mode
==============================================

`octave-auto-indent'
  Non-nil means indent current line after a semicolon or space.
  Default is nil.

`octave-auto-newline'
  Non-nil means auto-insert a newline and indent after a semicolon.
  Default is nil.

`octave-blink-matching-block'
  Non-nil means show matching begin of block when inserting a space,
  newline or semicolon after an else or end keyword.  Default is t.

`octave-block-offset'
  Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.
  Default is 2.

`octave-continuation-offset'
  Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.
  Default is 4.

`octave-continuation-string'
  String used for Octave continuation lines.
  Default is a backslash.

`octave-send-echo-input'
  Non-nil means always display `inferior-octave-buffer' after sending a
  command to the inferior Octave process.

`octave-send-line-auto-forward'
  Non-nil means always go to the next unsent line of Octave code after
  sending a line to the inferior Octave process.

`octave-send-echo-input'
  Non-nil means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.

Turning on Octave mode runs the hook `octave-mode-hook'.

To begin using this mode for all `.m' files that you edit, add the
following lines to your `.emacs' file:

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.m\\\\'\" . octave-mode))

To automatically turn on the abbrev and auto-fill features,
add the following lines to your `.emacs' file as well:

  (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook
	    (lambda ()
	      (abbrev-mode 1)
	      (auto-fill-mode 1)))

To submit a problem report, enter \\[octave-submit-bug-report] from an Octave mode buffer.
This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version information
already added.  You just need to add a description of the problem,
including a reproducible test case and send the message.

Org-mode develops organizational tasks around a NOTES file which
contains information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is
implemented on top of outline-mode, which is ideal to keep the content
of large files well structured.  It supports ToDo items, deadlines and
time stamps, which magically appear in the diary listing of the Emacs
calendar.  Tables are easily created with a built-in table editor.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails (VM), Usenet
messages (Gnus), BBDB entries, and any files related to the project.
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file (or a part of it)
can be exported as a structured ASCII or HTML file.

file the text at a specific location.

file, or you can use vertical cursor motion and visibility cycling (TAB) to
find a better place.  Then press RET or <left> or <right> in insert the note.

		 Like deadlines, these entries only show up in the
		 diary for *today*, not at any other date.

The call in the diary file should look like this:

   &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/some/orgfile.org

Use a separate line for each org file to check.  Or, if you omit the file name,
all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:

   &%%(org-diary)

If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default
arguments (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp) are used.
So the example above may also be written as

   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)

The function expects the lisp variables `entry' and `date' to be provided
by the caller, because this is how the calendar works.  Don't use this
function from a program - use `org-agenda-get-day-entries' instead.

Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.
Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,
two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.

Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily
invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end
of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked
back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).

\\[outline-previous-visible-heading]   outline-previous-visible-heading

\\[hide-body]	make all text invisible (not headings).
\\[show-all]	make everything in buffer visible.
\\[hide-sublevels]  make only the first N levels of headers visible.

The remaining commands are used when point is on a heading line.

\\[hide-subtree]   hide-subtree	make body and subheadings invisible.

\\[show-children]   show-children	make direct subheadings visible.
		 No effect on body, or subheadings 2 or more levels down.

A line is a heading if `outline-regexp' matches something at the

    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `perl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 `perl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `perl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `perl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `perl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 `perl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `perl-indent-continued-arguments'
    Offset of argument lines relative to usual indentation.

Various indentation styles:       K&R  BSD  BLK  GNU  LW
  perl-indent-level                5    8    0    2    4

`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be
printed using `pr-ps-mode-ps-print'.


Interactively, you have the following situations:

   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and printing will
      immediatelly be done using the current active printer.

   C-u   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
   C-u 0 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a current
      PostScript printer, then printing will immediatelly be done using the new
      current active printer.

   C-u 1 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a file name,
      and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
      printer.

   C-u 2 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value, then for a current
      PostScript printer and, finally, for a file name.  Then change the active
      printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in
      that file instead of sending it to the printer.


Noninteractively, the argument N-UP should be a positive integer greater than
zero and the argument SELECT is treated as follows:

   If it's nil, send the image to the printer.

   If it's a list or an integer lesser or equal to zero, the command prompts
   the user for a current PostScript printer, then printing will immediatelly
   be done using the new current active printer.

   If it's an integer equal to 1, the command prompts the user for a file name
   and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
   printer.

   If it's an integer greater or equal to 2, the command prompts the user for a
   current PostScript printer and for a file name.  Then change the active
   printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in that file
   instead of sending it to the printer.

   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-ps-printer-alist', it's the new

commands for running Python under Emacs.

The Emacs commands which work with `defun's, e.g. \\[beginning-of-defun], deal
with nested `def' and `class' blocks.  They take the innermost one as
current without distinguishing method and class definitions.  Used multiple
times, they move over others at the same indentation level until they reach
the end of definitions at that level, when they move up a level.
\\<python-mode-map>
Colon is electric: it outdents the line if appropriate, e.g. for
an else statement.  \\[python-backspace] at the beginning of an indented statement
deletes a level of indentation to close the current block; otherwise it
deletes a character backward.  TAB indents the current line relative to
the preceding code.  Successive TABs, with no intervening command, cycle
through the possibilities for indentation on the basis of enclosing blocks.

\\[fill-paragraph] fills comments and multi-line strings appropriately, but has no
effect outside them.

Supports Eldoc mode (only for functions, using a Python process),
Info-Look and Imenu.  In Outline minor mode, `class' and `def'
lines count as headers.  Symbol completion is available in the

With optional \\[universal-argument], the user is prompted for the

programmatically, or when running in Emacs 19.34 or older.

Note: You can toggle between using the CPython interpreter and the
JPython interpreter by hitting \\[python-toggle-shells].  This toggles
buffer local variables which control whether all your subshell
interactions happen to the `*JPython*' or `*Python*' buffers (the
latter is the name used for the CPython buffer).

Warning: Don't use an interactive Python if you change sys.ps1 or
sys.ps2 from their default values, or if you're running code that
prints `>>> ' or `... ' at the start of a line.  `python-mode' can't
distinguish your output from Python's output, and assumes that `>>> '
at the start of a line is a prompt from Python.  Similarly, the Emacs
Shell mode code assumes that both `>>> ' and `... ' at the start of a
line are Python prompts.  Bad things can happen if you fool either
mode.

Warning:  If you do any editing *in* the process buffer *while* the
buffer is accepting output from Python, do NOT attempt to `undo' the
changes.  Some of the output (nowhere near the parts you changed!) may
be lost if you do.  This appears to be an Emacs bug, an unfortunate
interaction between undo and process filters; the same problem exists in

 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.

GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.

DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.  The command
`describe-input-method' shows this string while replacing the form
\\=\\<VAR> in the string by the value of VAR.  That value should be a
string.  For instance, the form \\=\\<quail-translation-docstring> is
replaced by a description about how to select a translation from a
list of candidates.

TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.

FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.

DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.

KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.

SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the `quail-help' command should show
the user's keyboard layout visually with translated characters.
If KBD-TRANSLATE is set, it is desirable to set also this flag unless
this package defines no translations for single character keys.

CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.

MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key \"..ABCD\" but have translations of \"..AB\" and \"CD..\", break
the key at \"..AB\" and start translation of \"CD..\".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at \"..ABC\" and start translation of \"D..\".

OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.

UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By
default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation
for it) is inserted.

CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.

If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of
commands such as C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p and TAB; they are treated as
non-Quail commands.

(autoload 'rlogin "rlogin" "\
Open a network login connection via `rlogin' with args INPUT-ARGS.
INPUT-ARGS should start with a host name; it may also contain
other arguments for `rlogin'.

Input is sent line-at-a-time to the remote connection.

Communication with the remote host is recorded in a buffer `*rlogin-HOST*'
\(or `*rlogin-USER@HOST*' if the remote username differs).
If a prefix argument is given and the buffer `*rlogin-HOST*' already exists,
a new buffer with a different connection will be made.

When called from a program, if the optional second argument BUFFER is
a string or buffer, it specifies the buffer to use.

The variable `rlogin-program' contains the name of the actual program to
run.  It can be a relative or absolute path.

The variable `rlogin-explicit-args' is a list of arguments to give to
the rlogin when starting.  They are added after any arguments given in
INPUT-ARGS.

If the default value of `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' is t, then the
default directory in that buffer is set to a remote (FTP) file name to
access your home directory on the remote machine.  Occasionally this causes
an error, if you cannot access the home directory on that machine.  This
error is harmless as long as you don't try to use that default directory.

If `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' is neither t nor nil, then the default
directory is initially set up to your (local) home directory.
This is useful if the remote machine and your local machine
share the same files via NFS.  This is the default.

If you wish to change directory tracking styles during a session, use the
function `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' rather than simply setting the
variable.

Minor mode performing continual validation against a RELAX NG schema.

`(: SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(seq SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(sequence SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches what SEXP1 matches, followed by what SEXP2 matches, etc.

`(submatch SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(group SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     like `and', but makes the match accessible with `match-end',
     `match-beginning', and `match-string'.

`(group SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     another name for `submatch'.

`(or SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(| SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches anything that matches SEXP1 or SEXP2, etc.  If all
     args are strings, use `regexp-opt' to optimize the resulting
     regular expression.

`(minimal-match SEXP)'
     produce a non-greedy regexp for SEXP.  Normally, regexps matching
     zero or more occurrences of something are \"greedy\" in that they
     match as much as they can, as long as the overall regexp can
     still match.  A non-greedy regexp matches as little as possible.

`(maximal-match SEXP)'
     produce a greedy regexp for SEXP.  This is the default.

Below, `SEXP ...' represents a sequence of regexp forms, treated as if
enclosed in `(and ...)'.

`(zero-or-more SEXP ...)'
`(0+ SEXP ...)'
     matches zero or more occurrences of what SEXP ... matches.

`(* SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp, independent
     of `rx-greedy-flag'.

`(*? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp,
     independent of `rx-greedy-flag'.

`(one-or-more SEXP ...)'
`(1+ SEXP ...)'
     matches one or more occurrences of SEXP ...

`(+ SEXP ...)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(+? SEXP ...)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(zero-or-one SEXP ...)'
`(optional SEXP ...)'
`(opt SEXP ...)'
     matches zero or one occurrences of A.

`(? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(?? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(repeat N SEXP)'
`(= N SEXP ...)'
     matches N occurrences.

`(>= N SEXP ...)'
     matches N or more occurrences.

`(repeat N M SEXP)'
`(** N M SEXP ...)'
     matches N to M occurrences.

`(backref N)'
    matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(backref N)'
     matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(backref N)'
    matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(eval FORM)'
     evaluate FORM and insert result.  If result is a string,
     `regexp-quote' it.

`(regexp REGEXP)'
     include REGEXP in string notation in the result.

The normal hook `mail-setup-hook' is run after the message is
initialized.  It can add more default fields to the message.

The first argument, NOERASE, determines what to do when there is
an existing modified `*mail*' buffer.  If NOERASE is nil, the
existing mail buffer is used, and the user is prompted whether to
keep the old contents or to erase them.  If NOERASE has the value
`new', a new mail buffer will be created instead of using the old
one.  Any other non-nil value means to always select the old
buffer without erasing the contents.

The second through fifth arguments,
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC, specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer which contains an
 original message being replied to, or else an action

To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:

<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.

<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal M-o or
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.

Pages can have <a name=\"SOMENAME\">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href=\"#SOMENAME\">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href=\"URL\">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.

Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src=\"URL\">.

If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.

Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:
\\<sh-mode-map>
\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\\[sh-select]	 select loop
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
\\[sh-show-indent]	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.
\\[sh-set-indent]	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.
\\[sh-learn-line-indent]	Change the indentation variable so this line
would indent to the way it currently is.
\\[sh-learn-buffer-indent]  Set the indentation variables so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.


\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-newline-and-indent]	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

\\[sh-maybe-here-document]	 Without prefix, following an unquoted < inserts here document.
{, (, [, ', \", `
	Unless quoted with \\, insert the pairs {}, (), [], or '', \"\", ``.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.

If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use \\[executable-interpret]
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.

Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.

This function lists potential load path problems.  Directories in
the `load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is \"hidden\" by
the earlier.

For example, suppose `load-path' is set to

\(\"/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp\" \"/usr/gnu/emacs/share/emacs/19.30/lisp\")

and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
\(require 'XXX), (autoload .... \"XXX\"), (load-library \"XXX\") etc.

The first XXX.el file prevents Emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via `load-file').

When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of Emacs prior to
19.30.  An Emacs maintainer downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the Emacs distribution.
Unless the Emacs maintainer checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
Emacs version).

This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
\(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.

When run interactively, the shadowings (if any) are displayed in a
buffer called `*Shadows*'.  Shadowings are located by calling the
\(non-interactive) companion function, `find-emacs-lisp-shadows'.

	nil	skipped

After termination, point will be positioned at the last occurrence of -
or at the first occurrence of _ or at the end of the inserted text.

Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.  ELEMENT may
itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted repeatedly for
different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as the user enters a
non-empty string.  \\[keyboard-quit] terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in such
a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a \".. %s ..\" it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list of
strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.

Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return t since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:

	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR
		then: insert previously read string once more
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or nil
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str
	v1, v2	local variables for memorizing anything you want

`skeleton-end-hook' if that is non-nil.

What is Solitaire?

I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:

	Le Solitaire
	============

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

	o   o   o   .   o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.

A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .

Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o

That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:

		o   o   o

		.   o   o

	o   o   .   o   o   o   o

	o   .   o   o   o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

(autoload 'sort-subr "sort" "\
General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.

We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces
called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.

Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within sort-subr.

NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.
It moves point to the start of the next record.
It should move point to the end of the buffer if there are no more records.
The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when sort-subr
is called.

ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.
It should move point to the end of the record.

STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or
else the key is the substring between the values of point after
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key
starts at the beginning of the record.

ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the sort key to the end of the sort key.
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the
same as ENDRECFUN.

PREDICATE is the function to use to compare keys.  If keys are numbers,
it defaults to `<', otherwise it defaults to `string<'.

    -!-

Type \\[table-insert] and hit ENTER key.  As it asks table
specification, provide 3 for number of columns, 1 for number of rows,
5 for cell width and 1 for cell height.  Now you shall see the next
table and the point is automatically moved to the beginning of the

    +--------------+-----+-----+

    +--------------+-----+-----+

Type TAB \\[table-widen-cell] then type TAB M-2 M-7 \\[table-widen-cell] (or \\[universal-argument] 2 7 \\[table-widen-cell]).  Typing
TAB moves the point forward by a cell. The result now looks like this:

If you knew each width of the columns prior to the table creation,
what you could have done better was to have had given the complete
width information to `table-insert'.

Cell width(s): 14 6 32

instead of

Cell width(s): 5

This would have eliminated the previously mentioned width adjustment
work all together.

If the point is in the last cell type S-TAB S-TAB to move it to the
first cell.  Now type \\[table-heighten-cell] which heighten the row by a line.

(autoload 'table-insert-sequence "table" "\
Travel cells forward while inserting a specified sequence string in each cell.
STR is the base string from which the sequence starts.  When STR is an
empty string then each cell content is erased.  When STR ends with
numerical characters (they may optionally be surrounded by a pair of
parentheses) they are incremented as a decimal number.  Otherwise the
last character in STR is incremented in ASCII code order.  N is the
number of sequence elements to insert.  When N is negative the cell
traveling direction is backward.  When N is zero it travels forward
entire table.  INCREMENT is the increment between adjacent sequence
elements and can be a negative number for effectively decrementing.
INTERVAL is the number of cells to travel between sequence element
insertion which is normally 1.  When zero or less is given for
INTERVAL it is interpreted as number of cells per row so that sequence
is placed straight down vertically as long as the table's cell
structure is uniform.  JUSTIFY is one of the symbol 'left, 'center or
'right, that specifies justification of the inserted string.

Example:

  (progn
    (table-insert 16 3 5 1)
    (table-forward-cell 15)
    (table-insert-sequence \"D0\" -16 1 1 'center)

(autoload 'table-capture "table" "\
Convert plain text into a table by capturing the text in the region.
Create a table with the text in region as cell contents.  BEG and END
specify the region.  The text in the region is replaced with a table.
The removed text is inserted in the table.  When optional
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are provided the region contents
is parsed and separated into individual cell contents by using the
delimiter regular expressions.  This parsing determines the number of
columns and rows of the table automatically.  If COL-DELIM-REGEXP and
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are omitted the result table has only one cell and
the entire region contents is placed in that cell.  Optional JUSTIFY
is one of 'left, 'center or 'right, which specifies the cell
justification.  Optional MIN-CELL-WIDTH specifies the minimum cell
width.  Optional COLUMNS specify the number of columns when
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP is not specified.


Example 1:

1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8
, 9, 10

Running `table-capture' on above 3 line region with COL-DELIM-REGEXP
\",\" and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP \"\\n\" creates the following table.  In
this example the cells are centered and minimum cell width is
specified as 5.

+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Note:

In case the function is called interactively user must use \\[quoted-insert] `quoted-insert'
in order to enter \"\\n\" successfully.  COL-DELIM-REGEXP at the end
of each row is optional.


Example 2:

This example shows how a table can be used for text layout editing.
Let `table-capture' capture the following region starting from
-!- and ending at -*-, that contains three paragraphs and two item
name headers.  This time specify empty string for both
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP.

-!-`table-capture' is a powerful command however mastering its power
requires some practice.  Here is a list of items what it can do.

Parse Cell Items      By using column delimiter regular
		      expression and raw delimiter regular
		      expression, it parses the specified text
		      area and extracts cell items from
		      non-table text and then forms a table out
		      of them.

Capture Text Area     When no delimiters are specified it
		      creates a single cell table.  The text in
		      the specified region is placed in that
		      cell.-*-

Now the entire content is captured in a cell which is itself a table
like this.

Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \\[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \\[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \\[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \\[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

Here are the functions:

    texinfo-update-node                \\[texinfo-update-node]
    texinfo-every-node-update          \\[texinfo-every-node-update]
    texinfo-sequential-node-update

    texinfo-make-menu                  \\[texinfo-make-menu]
    texinfo-all-menus-update           \\[texinfo-all-menus-update]
    texinfo-master-menu

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'.

Finally, you will be prompted for the name of the file to store the key

Either way, there's nothing that tpu-mapper can do about it.  You must

your local X guru can try to figure out why the key is being ignored.

keystroke even though they really require multiple keys to generate them.

(autoload 'type-break-mode "type-break" "\
Enable or disable typing-break mode.
This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.

When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, Emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.

A negative prefix argument disables this mode.
No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.

The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.

If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.

The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.

If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if Emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.  A nil value for this variable prevents automatic
break rescheduling, making `type-break-interval' an upper bound on the time
between breaks.  In this case breaks will be prompted for as usual before
the upper bound if the keystroke threshold is reached.

If `type-break-good-rest-interval' is nil and
`type-break-good-break-interval' is set, then confirmation is required to
interrupt a break before `type-break-good-break-interval' seconds
have passed.  This provides for an upper bound on the time between breaks
together with confirmation of interruptions to these breaks.

The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.

There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about
imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:

        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'
        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-keystroke-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-warning-repeat'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'

There are several variables that affect if, how, and when queries to begin
a typing break occur.  They include:

        `type-break-query-mode'
        `type-break-query-function'
        `type-break-query-interval'

The command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things.

Finally, a file (named `type-break-file-name') is used to store information
across Emacs sessions.  This provides recovery of the break status between
sessions and after a crash.  Manual changes to the file may result in
problems.

Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.

If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your
maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate
average typing speed.)

From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of
the computed maximum threshold.

When called from Lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.
FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.

Usage:
------

  INDENTATION:  Typing `TAB' at the beginning of a line indents the line.
    The amount of indentation is specified by option `vera-basic-offset'.
    Indentation can be done for an entire region (`M-C-\\') or buffer (menu).
    `TAB' always indents the line if option `vera-intelligent-tab' is nil.

  WORD/COMMAND COMPLETION:  Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks
    for a word in the buffer or a Vera keyword that starts alike, inserts it
    and adjusts case.  Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word
    completions.

    Typing `TAB' after a non-word character inserts a tabulator stop (if not
    at the beginning of a line).  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator stop.

  COMMENTS:  `C-c C-c' comments out a region if not commented out, and
    uncomments a region if already commented out.

  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Vera keywords, predefined types and
    constants, function names, declaration names, directives, as well as
    comments and strings are highlighted using different colors.

  VERA VERSION:  OpenVera 1.4 and Vera version 6.2.8.

NEWLINE, TAB indents for Verilog code.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Supports highlighting.

Turning on Verilog mode calls the value of the variable `verilog-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.

Variables controlling indentation/edit style:

 variable `verilog-indent-level'      (default 3)
   Indentation of Verilog statements with respect to containing block.
 `verilog-indent-level-module'        (default 3)
   Absolute indentation of Module level Verilog statements.
   Set to 0 to get initial and always statements lined up
   on the left side of your screen.
 `verilog-indent-level-declaration'   (default 3)
   Indentation of declarations with respect to containing block.
   Set to 0 to get them list right under containing block.
 `verilog-indent-level-behavioral'    (default 3)
   Indentation of first begin in a task or function block
   Set to 0 to get such code to lined up underneath the task or
   function keyword.
 `verilog-indent-level-directive'     (default 1)
   Indentation of `ifdef/`endif blocks.
 `verilog-cexp-indent'              (default 1)
   Indentation of Verilog statements broken across lines i.e.:
      if (a)
        begin
 `verilog-case-indent'              (default 2)
   Indentation for case statements.
 `verilog-auto-newline'             (default nil)
   Non-nil means automatically newline after semicolons and the punctuation
   mark after an end.
 `verilog-auto-indent-on-newline'   (default t)
   Non-nil means automatically indent line after newline.
 `verilog-tab-always-indent'        (default t)
   Non-nil means TAB in Verilog mode should always reindent the current line,
   regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `verilog-indent-begin-after-if'    (default t)
   Non-nil means to indent begin statements following a preceding
   if, else, while, for and repeat statements, if any.  Otherwise,
   the begin is lined up with the preceding token.  If t, you get:
      if (a)
         begin // amount of indent based on `verilog-cexp-indent'
   otherwise you get:
      if (a)
      begin
 `verilog-auto-endcomments'         (default t)
   Non-nil means a comment /* ... */ is set after the ends which ends
   cases, tasks, functions and modules.
   The type and name of the object will be set between the braces.
 `verilog-minimum-comment-distance' (default 10)
   Minimum distance (in lines) between begin and end required before a comment
   will be inserted.  Setting this variable to zero results in every
   end acquiring a comment; the default avoids too many redundant
   comments in tight quarters.
 `verilog-auto-lineup'              (default `(all))
   List of contexts where auto lineup of code should be done.

Variables controlling other actions:

 `verilog-linter'                   (default surelint)

Major mode for editing VHDL code.

Usage:
------

  TEMPLATE INSERTION (electrification):
    After typing a VHDL keyword and entering `SPC', you are prompted for
    arguments while a template is generated for that VHDL construct.  Typing
    `RET' or `C-g' at the first (mandatory) prompt aborts the current
    template generation.  Optional arguments are indicated by square
    brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.  Prompts for
    mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is left
    empty.  They can be queried again by `C-c C-t C-q'.  Enabled
    electrification is indicated by `/e' in the modeline.

      Typing `M-SPC' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the
    template generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e.
    electrification) can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-e' or by
    setting option `vhdl-electric-mode' (see OPTIONS).

      Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key
    bindings, by typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing
    the keyword (i.e. first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and
    `SPC'.  The following abbreviations can also be used: arch, attr, cond,
    conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.

      Template styles can be customized in customization group
    `vhdl-template' (see OPTIONS).


  HEADER INSERTION:
    A file header can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-h'.  A file footer
    (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-f'.
    See customization group `vhdl-header'.


  STUTTERING:
    Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax elements.
    Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-s' or by
    option `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in
    the modeline.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:

      ;;   -->  \" : \"       [   -->  (        --    -->  comment
      ;;;  -->  \" := \"      [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code
      ..   -->  \" => \"      ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line
      ,,   -->  \" <= \"      ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment
      ==   -->  \" == \"      ''  -->  \\\"


  WORD COMPLETION:
    Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL keyword or a
    word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts case.
    Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word completions.  This also
    works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).

      Typing `TAB' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized
    expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as
    standard types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations
    (e.g. type \"std\" and `TAB' will toggle through all standard types
    beginning with \"std\").

      Typing `TAB' after a non-word character indents the line if at the
    beginning of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters), and
    inserts a tabulator stop otherwise.  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator
    stop.


  COMMENTS:
        `--'       puts a single comment.
        `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.
        `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines
                   with a comment in between.
        `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments
                   out following lines.
        `C-c c'    comments out a region if not commented out,
                   uncomments a region if already commented out.

      You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,
    variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process
    specifications if option `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.
    Comments are automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after
    begin statements) and as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is
    non-nil.

      Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line)
    are indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at
    maximum to `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `RET' after a space in a comment
    will open a new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column'
    in a comment automatically opens a new comment line.  `M-q' re-fills
    multi-line comments.


  INDENTATION:
    `TAB' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.  The amount of
    indentation is specified by option `vhdl-basic-offset'.  `C-c C-i C-l'
    always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if option
    `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).

      Indentation can be done for a group of lines (`C-c C-i C-g'), a region
    (`M-C-\\') or the entire buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are
    indented normally (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil)
    according to option `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.

      If option `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil, spaces are used instead of
    tabs.  `M-x tabify' and `M-x untabify' allow to convert spaces to tabs
    and vice versa.

      Syntax-based indentation can be very slow in large files.  Option
    `vhdl-indent-syntax-based' allows to use faster but simpler indentation.


  ALIGNMENT:
    The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline comments
    to beautify the code.  `C-c C-a C-a' aligns a group of consecutive lines
    separated by blank lines, `C-c C-a C-i' a block of lines with same
    indent.  `C-c C-a C-l' aligns all lines belonging to a list enclosed by
    a pair of parentheses (e.g. port clause/map, argument list), and `C-c
    C-a C-d' all lines within the declarative part of a design unit.  `C-c
    C-a M-a' aligns an entire region.  `C-c C-a C-c' aligns inline comments
    for a group of lines, and `C-c C-a M-c' for a region.

      If option `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code lines
    separated by special lines (see option `vhdl-align-group-separate') are
    aligned individually.  If option `vhdl-align-same-indent' is non-nil,
    blocks of lines with same indent are aligned separately.  Some templates
    are automatically aligned after generation if option `vhdl-auto-align'
    is non-nil.

      Alignment tries to align inline comments at
    `vhdl-inline-comment-column' and tries inline comment not to exceed
    `vhdl-end-comment-column'.

      `C-c C-x M-w' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator
    symbols are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.


  CODE FILLING:
    Code filling allows to condense code (e.g. sensitivity lists or port
    maps) by removing comments and newlines and re-wrapping so that all
    lines are maximally filled (block filling).  `C-c C-f C-f' fills a list
    enclosed by parenthesis, `C-c C-f C-g' a group of lines separated by
    blank lines, `C-c C-f C-i' a block of lines with same indent, and
    `C-c C-f M-f' an entire region.


  CODE BEAUTIFICATION:
    `C-c M-b' and `C-c C-b' beautify the code of a region or of the entire
    buffer respectively.  This inludes indentation, alignment, and case
    fixing.  Code beautification can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:

      emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs filename.vhd -f vhdl-beautify-buffer


  PORT TRANSLATION:
    Generic and port clauses from entity or component declarations can be
    copied (`C-c C-p C-w') and pasted as entity and component declarations,
    as component instantiations and corresponding internal constants and
    signals, as a generic map with constants as actual generics, and as
    internal signal initializations (menu).

      To include formals in component instantiations, see option
    `vhdl-association-list-with-formals'.  To include comments in pasting,
    see options `vhdl-include-...-comments'.

      A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be
    flattened (`C-c C-p C-f') so that only one name per line exists.  The
    direction of ports can be reversed (`C-c C-p C-r'), i.e., inputs become
    outputs and vice versa, which can be useful in testbenches.  (This
    reversion is done on the internal data structure and is only reflected
    in subsequent paste operations.)

      Names for actual ports, instances, testbenches, and
    design-under-test instances can be derived from existing names according
    to options `vhdl-...-name'.  See customization group `vhdl-port'.


  SUBPROGRAM TRANSLATION:
    Similar functionality exists for copying/pasting the interface of
    subprograms (function/procedure).  A subprogram interface can be copied
    and then pasted as a subprogram declaration, body or call (uses
    association list with formals).


  TESTBENCH GENERATION:
    A copied port can also be pasted as a testbench.  The generated
    testbench includes an entity, an architecture, and an optional
    configuration.  The architecture contains the component declaration and
    instantiation of the DUT as well as internal constant and signal
    declarations.  Additional user-defined templates can be inserted.  The
    names used for entity/architecture/configuration/DUT as well as the file
    structure to be generated can be customized. See customization group
   `vhdl-testbench'.


  KEY BINDINGS:
    Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in menu).


  VHDL MENU:
    All commands can be found in the VHDL menu including their key bindings.


  FILE BROWSER:
    The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.  It can
    be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if option
    `vhdl-speedbar-auto-open' is non-nil.

      In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and
    browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.


  DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:
    The speedbar can also be used for browsing the hierarchy of design units
    contained in the source files of the current directory or the specified
    projects (see option `vhdl-project-alist').

      The speedbar can be switched between file, directory hierarchy and
    project hierarchy browsing mode in the speedbar menu or by typing `f',
    `h' or `H' in speedbar.

      In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse
    their hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  Ports can directly be copied
    from entities and components (in packages).  Individual design units and
    complete designs can directly be compiled (\"Make\" menu entry).

      The hierarchy is automatically updated upon saving a modified source
    file when option `vhdl-speedbar-update-on-saving' is non-nil.  The
    hierarchy is only updated for projects that have been opened once in the
    speedbar.  The hierarchy is cached between Emacs sessions in a file (see
    options in group `vhdl-speedbar').

      Simple design consistency checks are done during scanning, such as
    multiple declarations of the same unit or missing primary units that are
    required by secondary units.


  STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION:
    Enables simple structural composition.  `C-c C-c C-n' creates a skeleton
    for a new component.  Subcomponents (i.e. component declaration and
    instantiation) can be automatically placed from a previously read port
    (`C-c C-c C-p') or directly from the hierarchy browser (`P').  Finally,
    all subcomponents can be automatically connected using internal signals
    and ports (`C-c C-c C-w') following these rules:
      - subcomponent actual ports with same name are considered to be
        connected by a signal (internal signal or port)
      - signals that are only inputs to subcomponents are considered as
        inputs to this component -> input port created
      - signals that are only outputs from subcomponents are considered as
        outputs from this component -> output port created
      - signals that are inputs to AND outputs from subcomponents are
        considered as internal connections -> internal signal created

      Purpose:  With appropriate naming conventions it is possible to
    create higher design levels with only a few mouse clicks or key
    strokes.  A new design level can be created by simply generating a new
    component, placing the required subcomponents from the hierarchy
    browser, and wiring everything automatically.

      Note: Automatic wiring only works reliably on templates of new
    components and component instantiations that were created by VHDL mode.

      Component declarations can be placed in a components package (option
    `vhdl-use-components-package') which can be automatically generated for
    an entire directory or project (`C-c C-c M-p').  The VHDL'93 direct
    component instantiation is also supported (option
    `vhdl-use-direct-instantiation').

|     Configuration declarations can automatically be generated either from
|   the menu (`C-c C-c C-f') (for the architecture the cursor is in) or from
|   the speedbar menu (for the architecture under the cursor).  The
|   configurations can optionally be hierarchical (i.e. include all
|   component levels of a hierarchical design, option
|   `vhdl-compose-configuration-hierarchical') or include subconfigurations
|   (option `vhdl-compose-configuration-use-subconfiguration').  For
|   subcomponents in hierarchical configurations, the most-recently-analyzed
|   (mra) architecture is selected.  If another architecture is desired, it
|   can be marked as most-recently-analyzed (speedbar menu) before
|   generating the configuration.
|
|     Note: Configurations of subcomponents (i.e. hierarchical configuration
|   declarations) are currently not considered when displaying
|   configurations in speedbar.

      See the options group `vhdl-compose' for all relevant user options.


  SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:
    The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed by calling a VHDL
    compiler (menu, `C-c C-k').  The compiler to be used is specified by
    option `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed in option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,
    command options, compilation directory, and error message syntax
    information.  New compilers can be added.

      All the source files of an entire design can be compiled by the `make'
    command (menu, `C-c M-C-k') if an appropriate Makefile exists.


  MAKEFILE GENERATION:
    Makefiles can be generated automatically by an internal generation
    routine (`C-c M-k').  The library unit dependency information is
    obtained from the hierarchy browser.  Makefile generation can be
    customized for each compiler in option `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

      Makefile generation can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:

        emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l vhdl-mode
              [-compiler compilername] [-project projectname]
              -f vhdl-generate-makefile

      The Makefile's default target \"all\" compiles the entire design, the
    target \"clean\" removes it and the target \"library\" creates the
    library directory if not existent.  The Makefile also includes a target
    for each primary library unit which allows selective compilation of this
    unit, its secondary units and its subhierarchy (example: compilation of
    a design specified by a configuration).  User specific parts can be
    inserted into a Makefile with option `vhdl-makefile-generation-hook'.

    Limitations:
      - Only library units and dependencies within the current library are
        considered.  Makefiles for designs that span multiple libraries are
        not (yet) supported.
      - Only one-level configurations are supported (also hierarchical),
        but configurations that go down several levels are not.
      - The \"others\" keyword in configurations is not supported.


  PROJECTS:
    Projects can be defined in option `vhdl-project-alist' and a current
    project be selected using option `vhdl-project' (permanently) or from
    the menu or speedbar (temporarily).  For each project, title and
    description strings (for the file headers), source files/directories
    (for the hierarchy browser and Makefile generation), library name, and
    compiler-dependent options, exceptions and compilation directory can be
    specified.  Compilation settings overwrite the settings of option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

      Project setups can be exported (i.e. written to a file) and imported.
    Imported setups are not automatically saved in `vhdl-project-alist' but
    can be saved afterwards in its customization buffer.  When starting
    Emacs with VHDL Mode (i.e. load a VHDL file or use \"emacs -l
    vhdl-mode\") in a directory with an existing project setup file, it is
    automatically loaded and its project activated if option
    `vhdl-project-auto-load' is non-nil.  Names/paths of the project setup
    files can be specified in option `vhdl-project-file-name'.  Multiple
    project setups can be automatically loaded from global directories.
    This is an alternative to specifying project setups with option
    `vhdl-project-alist'.


  SPECIAL MENUES:
    As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can be added (set
    option `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible as a mouse menu
    (e.g. add \"(global-set-key '[S-down-mouse-3] 'imenu)\" to your start-up
    file) for browsing the file contents (is not populated if buffer is
    larger than `font-lock-maximum-size').  Also, a source file menu can be
    added (set option `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing the
    current directory for VHDL source files.


  VHDL STANDARDS:
    The VHDL standards to be used are specified in option `vhdl-standard'.
    Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93, VHDL-AMS, and Math Packages.


  KEYWORD CASE:
    Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types, attributes,
    and enumeration values is supported.  If the option
    `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in
    lower case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for
    types, attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords,
    types, attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire
    region (menu) or buffer (`C-c C-x C-c') according to the options
    `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.


  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):
    Keywords and standardized types, attributes, enumeration values, and
    function names (controlled by option `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well
    as comments, strings, and template prompts are highlighted using
    different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal, variable, constant,
    parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well as labels are
    highlighted if option `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.

      Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words
    that should be avoided) can be specified in option
    `vhdl-forbidden-words' or `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in
    a warning color (option `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog
    keywords are highlighted as forbidden words if option
    `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.

      Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their
    syntax and color in option `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting
    option `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows to
    establish some naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds
    of signals or other objects by using name suffices) and to support them
    visually.

      Option `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order
    to support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only
    highlighted if written in lower case.

      Code between \"translate_off\" and \"translate_on\" pragmas is
    highlighted using a different background color if option
    `vhdl-highlight-translate-off' is non-nil.

      For documentation and customization of the used colors see
    customization group `vhdl-highlight-faces' (`M-x customize-group').  For
    highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group
    `paren-showing'.  Automatic buffer highlighting is turned on/off by
    option `global-font-lock-mode' (`font-lock-auto-fontify' in XEmacs).


  USER MODELS:
    VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made accessible
    in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword
    electrification.  See option `vhdl-model-alist'.


  HIDE/SHOW:
    The code of blocks, processes, subprograms, component declarations and
    instantiations, generic/port clauses, and configuration declarations can
    be hidden using the `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within
    the code (see customization group `vhdl-menu').  XEmacs: limited
    functionality due to old `hideshow.el' package.


  CODE UPDATING:
    - Sensitivity List: `C-c C-u C-s' updates the sensitivity list of the
      current process, `C-c C-u M-s' of all processes in the current buffer.
      Limitations:
        - Only declared local signals (ports, signals declared in
          architecture and blocks) are automatically inserted.
        - Global signals declared in packages are not automatically inserted.
          Insert them once manually (will be kept afterwards).
        - Out parameters of procedures are considered to be read.
      Use option `vhdl-entity-file-name' to specify the entity file name
      (used to obtain the port names).


  CODE FIXING:
    `C-c C-x C-p' fixes the closing parenthesis of a generic/port clause
    (e.g. if the closing parenthesis is on the wrong line or is missing).


  PRINTING:
    Postscript printing with different faces (an optimized set of faces is
    used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors (if
    `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs
    postscript printing commands.  Option `vhdl-print-two-column' defines
    appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.
    The paper format can be set by option `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to
    switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white
    printers.


  OPTIONS:
    User options allow customization of VHDL Mode.  All options are
    accessible from the \"Options\" menu entry.  Simple options (switches
    and choices) can directly be changed, while for complex options a
    customization buffer is opened.  Changed options can be saved for future
    sessions using the \"Save Options\" menu entry.

      Options and their detailed descriptions can also be accessed by using
    the \"Customize\" menu entry or the command `M-x customize-option' (`M-x
    customize-group' for groups).  Some customizations only take effect
    after some action (read the NOTE in the option documentation).
    Customization can also be done globally (i.e. site-wide, read the
    INSTALL file).

      Not all options are described in this documentation, so go and see
    what other useful user options there are (`M-x vhdl-customize' or menu)!


  FILE EXTENSIONS:
    As default, files with extensions \".vhd\" and \".vhdl\" are
    automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension
    \".xxx\", add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):

      (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.xxx\\\\'\" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist))


  HINTS:
    - To start Emacs with open VHDL hierarchy browser without having to load
      a VHDL file first, use the command:

        emacs -l vhdl-mode -f speedbar-frame-mode

    - Type `C-g C-g' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.

    - Some features only work on properly indented code.

;;; Generated autoloads from emulation/vi.el

(autoload 'vi-mode "vi" "\
Major mode that acts like the `vi' editor.
The purpose of this mode is to provide you the combined power of vi (namely,
the \"cross product\" effect of commands and repeat last changes) and Emacs.

This command redefines nearly all keys to look like vi commands.
It records the previous major mode, and any vi command for input
\(`i', `a', `s', etc.) switches back to that mode.
Thus, ordinary Emacs (in whatever major mode you had been using)
is \"input\" mode as far as vi is concerned.

To get back into vi from \"input\" mode, you must issue this command again.
Therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to a key.

Major differences between this mode and real vi :

* Limitations and unsupported features
  - Search patterns with line offset (e.g. /pat/+3 or /pat/z.) are
    not supported.
  - Ex commands are not implemented; try ':' to get some hints.
  - No line undo (i.e. the 'U' command), but multi-undo is a standard feature.

* Modifications
  - The stopping positions for some point motion commands (word boundary,
    pattern search) are slightly different from standard 'vi'.
    Also, no automatic wrap around at end of buffer for pattern searching.
  - Since changes are done in two steps (deletion then insertion), you need
    to undo twice to completely undo a change command.  But this is not needed
    for undoing a repeated change command.
  - No need to set/unset 'magic', to search for a string with regular expr
    in it just put a prefix arg for the search commands.  Replace cmds too.
  - ^R is bound to incremental backward search, so use ^L to redraw screen.

* Extensions
  - Some standard (or modified) Emacs commands were integrated, such as
    incremental search, query replace, transpose objects, and keyboard macros.
  - In command state, ^X links to the 'ctl-x-map', and ESC can be linked to
    esc-map or set undefined.  These can give you the full power of Emacs.
  - See vi-com-map for those keys that are extensions to standard vi, e.g.
    `vi-name-last-change-or-macro', `vi-verify-spelling', `vi-locate-def',
    `vi-mark-region', and 'vi-quote-words'.  Some of them are quite handy.
  - Use \\[vi-switch-mode] to switch among different modes quickly.

Syntax table and abbrevs while in vi mode remain as they were in Emacs.

with WINDOW when exiting.  It is one of:
1) nil            Do nothing.
