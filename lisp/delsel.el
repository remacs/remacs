;;; Commentary:

;; This file makes the active region be pending delete, meaning that
;; text inserted while the region is active will replace the region contents.
;; This is a popular behavior of personal computers text editors.

;; Interface:

;; Commands which will delete the selection need a 'delete-selection
;; property on their symbols; commands which insert text but don't
;; have this property won't delete the selection.  It can be one of
;; the values:
;;  'yank
;;      For commands which do a yank; ensures the region about to be
;;      deleted isn't yanked.
;;  'supersede
;;      Delete the active region and ignore the current command,
;;      i.e. the command will just delete the region.
;;  'kill
;;      `kill-region' is used on the selection, rather than
;;      `delete-region'.  (Text selected with the mouse will typically
;;      be yankable anyhow.)
;;  t
;;      The normal case: delete the active region prior to executing
;;      the command which will insert replacement text.
;;  <function>
;;      For commands which need to dynamically determine this behavior.
;;      The function should return one of the above values or nil.
