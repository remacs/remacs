;;; Commentary:

;; This file makes the active region be pending delete, meaning that
;; text inserted while the region is active will replace the region contents.
;; This is a popular behavior of personal computers text editors.

;; Interface:

;; Commands which will delete the selection need a 'delete-selection
;; property on their symbols; commands which insert text but don't
;; have this property won't delete the selection.  It can be one of
;; the values:
;;  `yank'
;;      For commands which do a yank; ensures the region about to be
;;      deleted isn't immediately yanked back, which would make the
;;      command a no-op.
;;  `supersede'
;;      Delete the active region and ignore the current command,
;;      i.e. the command will just delete the region.  This is for
;;      commands that normally delete small amounts of text, like
;;      a single character -- they will instead delete the whole
;;      active region.
;;  `kill'
;;      `kill-region' is used on the selection, rather than
;;      `delete-region'.  (Text selected with the mouse will typically
;;      be yankable anyhow.)
;;  t
;;      The normal case: delete the active region prior to executing
;;      the command which will insert replacement text.
;;  FUNCTION
;;      For commands which need to dynamically determine this behavior.
;;      FUNCTION should take no argument and return one of the above
;;      values, or nil.  In the latter case, FUNCTION should itself
;;      do with the active region whatever is appropriate."

  "Toggle Delete Selection mode.
Interactively, with a prefix argument, enable
Delete Selection mode if the prefix argument is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, toggle
the mode if ARG is `toggle', disable the mode if ARG is
a non-positive integer, and enable the mode otherwise
\(including if ARG is omitted or nil or a positive integer).

When Delete Selection mode is enabled, typed text replaces the selection
if the selection is active.  Otherwise, typed text is just inserted at
point regardless of any selection.  Also, commands that normally delete
just one character will delete the entire selection instead.

See `delete-selection-helper' and `delete-selection-pre-hook' for
information on adapting behavior of commands in Delete Selection mode."
