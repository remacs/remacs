;;; Commentary:

;; Defines a major mode for visiting image files
;; that allows conversion between viewing the text of the file
;; and viewing the file as an image.  Viewing the image
;; works by putting a `display' text-property on the
;; image data, with the image-data still present underneath; if the
;; resulting buffer file is saved to another name it will correctly save
;; the image data to the new file.

;; Todo:

;; Consolidate with doc-view to make them work on directories of images or on
;; image files containing various "pages".

;;; Code:

(require 'image)
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
