## Comments on loaddefs generation:

# loaddefs depends on gen-lisp for two reasons:
# 1) In ../src, the emacs target depends on loaddefs but not on eg leim-list.
# So having leim as a dependency of loaddefs (via gen-lisp) ensures leim-list
# gets created before the final emacs is dumped.  Having leim
# dependencies in ../src as well would create a parallel race condition.
#
# 2) Files that are marked no-update-autoloads still get recorded in loaddefs.
# So those files should be generated before we make autoloads, if we
# don't want a successive make autoloads to change the output file.
# Said changes are trivial (only comments in the "files without autoloads"
# section), but still can be annoying.  Of course, if generated lisp files
# do contain autoloads, it is essential they be built before make autoloads.
# (Also, if a generated file is not written atomically, it is possible that
# in a parallel build, make autoloads could read a partial version of it.)
#
# We'd really like to add "make -C ../admin/unidata all" to gen-lisp
# because of 2) above, but it causes a race condition in parallel
# builds because ../src also runs that rule.  Given the limitations of
# recursive make, the only way to fix that would be to remove unidata
# from ../src rules, but that doesn't seem possible due to the various
# non-trivial dependencies.

# We make $(lisp)/loaddefs.el a dependency of .PHONY to cause Make to
# ignore its time stamp.  That's because the real dependencies of
# loaddefs.el aren't known to Make, they are implemented in
# batch-update-autoloads, which only updates the autoloads whose
# sources have changed.

# Use expand-file-name rather than $abs_scrdir so that Emacs does not
# get confused when it compares file-names for equality.
