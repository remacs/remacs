2006-01-11  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	* mh-acros.el (mh-defun-compat, mh-defmacro-compat): Move here
	from mh-gnus.el.

	* mh-gnus.el: Require mh-acros.
	(mh-defmacro-compat, mh-defun-compat): Move to mh-acros.el.

	* mh-utils.el (mh-x-image-url-cache-canonicalize): Use
	url-hexify-string to remove special characters from filenames
	(closes SF #1396499). Note that this invalidates the existing
	names in your cache so you might as well remove
	~/Mail/.mhe-x-image-cache/* now.
	(url-unreserved-chars, url-hexify-string): Define if not defined.
	Copied from url-util.el in Emacs22 for Emacs 21.

	* mh-buffers.el: New file. Contains constants and code from
	mh-index.el and mh-utils.el.

	* mh-alias.el: 
	* mh-comp.el: 
	* mh-e.el: 
	* mh-funcs.el: 
	* mh-init.el:
	* mh-junk.el: 
	* mh-mime.el:
	* mh-print.el:
	* mh-seq.el: Require new file mh-buffers.el.

	* mh-index.el: Require new file mh-buffers.el.
	(mh-index-temp-buffer, mh-checksum-buffer): Move to new file
	mh-buffers.el.

	* mh-utils.el: Require new file mh-buffers.el.
	(mh-temp-buffer, mh-temp-fetch-buffer)
	(mh-aliases-buffer, mh-folders-buffer, mh-help-buffer)
	(mh-info-buffer, mh-log-buffer, mh-mail-delivery-buffer)
	(mh-recipients-buffer, mh-sequences-buffer, mh-log-buffer-lines)
	(mh-truncate-log-buffer): Move to new file mh-buffers.el.

	* mh-comp.el (mh-forward): Cosmetics on prompt when draft exists.
	(mh-send-letter): Add -msgid to mh-send-args (closes SF #725425).

2006-01-10  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	* mh-comp.el (mh-insert-letter): If you choose a different folder,
	the cur message is used. Sync docstring with manual (closes SF
	#1205890).

	* mh-mime.el (mh-compose-forward): Use standard range argument
	instead of messages. Use more powerful mh-read-range instead of
	read-string. Sync docstring with manual (close SF #1205890).

	* mh-index.el (mh-index-search): Checking mh-find-path-run is
	unnecessary.
	(mh-index-next-folder): Don't back up a line when going backwards
	since this skips the current folder heading if point is on the
	first message after the folder heading (closes SF #1126188).

	* mh-init.el (mh-sys-path): Co-locate with mh-variants, which uses
	it.
	(mh-variants): Note variable isn't meant to be accessed directly;
	use function mh-variants instead.
	(mh-variant-info, mh-variant-mh-info, mh-variant-mu-mh-info)
	(mh-variant-nmh-info): Co-locate next to mh-variants, which uses
	them. Updated to use mh-file-command-p which is more accurrate
	than file-executable-p which returns t for directories.
	(mh-file-command-p): Move here from mh-utils, since
	mh-variant-*-info are the only functions to use it.
	(mh-variant-set, mh-variant-set-variant, mh-variant-p): Use
	function mh-variants instead of variable. More robust.
	(mh-find-path-run): Move here from mh-utils.el. Mention that
	checking this variable is unnecessary.
	(mh-find-path): Move here from mh-utils.el. With the advent of MH
	variants and an mhparam command that doesn't work if there isn't
	an MH profile, we can't get libdir for running install-mh. So
	don't bother. If there's an issue with the environment, direct the
	user to install MH and run install-mh (closes SF #835192). Don't
	read ~/.mh_profile directly. Use mh-profile-component which uses
	mhparam (closes SF #1016027).

	* mh-utils.el (mh-get-profile-field): Rename to
	mh-profile-component-value. Add colon to search removing
	unnecessary addition of colon to field in mh-profile-component.
	(mh-profile-component): Modify call to mh-profile-component-value
	accordingly. Move next to mh-profile-component-value.
	(mh-find-path-run, mh-find-path, mh-file-command-p): Move to
	mh-init.el. It makes sense that code that is only run once per
	session (more or less) is in mh-init.el rather than cluttering
	mh-utils.el.
	(mh-no-install, mh-install): Delete.

	* mh-customize.el (mh-folder-msg-number): 
	* mh-mime.el (mh-file-mime-type): Removed trailing whitespace.

2006-01-09  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	* mh-init.el (mh-variant-mu-mh-info, mh-variant-nmh-info): Applied
	patch from Satyaki from SF #1016027.

	* mh-e.el (mh-rescan-folder): Try to keep cursor at current
	message, even if cur sequence is no longer present (closes SF
	#1207247).

	* mh-comp.el: Use ";; Shush compiler." comment consistently per
	Mark's suggestion.
	(mh-letter-mode): Derive from mail-mode and delete code copied
	from mail-mode (closes SF #1385571). Mention mail-mode-hook in
	docstring.
	(mh-fill-paragraph-function): Delete. Handled by mail-mode.
	(mh-to-field-choices): For consistency with mail-mode, add "a" for
	"Mail-Reply-To:", "l" for "Mail-Followup-To:", and "r" for
	"Reply-To:". Change "r" to "m" for "From:" (closes SF #1400139).
	(mh-to-fcc): Move setting of folder argument to interactive
	argument as is the norm.
	(mh-letter-complete-function-alist): Add mail-reply-to.
	(mh-letter-mode-map): Add keys for mh-to-field (Mail-Reply-To,
	Mail-Followup-To, Reply-To, From).

	* mh-customize.el: Use ";; Forward definition." consistently.
	Comment declaration to remind programmer to update forward
	definition if default changes.

	* mh-funcs.el: 
	* mh-inc.el: 
	* mh-init.el: 
	* mh-mime.el: 
	* mh-seq.el: 
	* mh-utils.el: Use ";; Shush compiler." comment consistently per
	Mark's suggestion.

2006-01-08  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	Removed code that was marked as Emacs 20 compatible that was
	easily found showing how important it is to document such
	things (closes SF #1359240). Feel free to nuke any other Emacs 20
	peculiarities that you find. Wrapped code for shushing compiler
	with (eval-when-compile), sometimes moving the defvars closer to
	where they were used.
	
	* mh-alias.el (mh-alias-gecos-name): Use replace-regexp-in-string
	instead of mh-replace-in-string as mh-replace-in-string was
	replaced by a more appropriate defsubst in mh-xemacs.el.

	* mh-comp.el: Require cleanup, wrap compiler-shushing defvars with
	eval-when-compile.
	(mh-file-is-vcard-p): Removed redundant test.

	* mh-customize.el: Require cleanup, wrap compiler-shushing defvars
	with eval-when-compile.

	(mh-invisible-header-fields-default): Alphabetize.

	* mh-e.el: Require cleanup, wrap compiler-shushing defvars with
	eval-when-compile.
	(mh-thread-scan-line-map-stack, tool-bar-mode): Delete unused
	variables.
	(mh-colors-available-p): Just call display-color-cells. It's on
	all supported Emacsen (and defaliased on XEmacs).

	* mh-funcs.el:
	* mh-inc.el:
	* mh-init.el: Wrap compiler-shushing defvars with
	eval-when-compile.

	* mh-identity.el: Don't need (mh-require-cl).

	* mh-index.el: Don't need to load executable any more.

	* mh-mime.el: Wrap compiler-shushing defvars with
	eval-when-compile.
	(mh-have-file-command): Initialize variable to 'undefined. Add
	docstring. Update function of same name accordingly. Also don't
	need to load executable any more.
	(mh-mime-content-types): Delete.
	(mh-minibuffer-read-type): Prompt user for type if
	mh-file-mime-type returns application/octet-stream. Assume we have
	mailcap-mime-types.
	(mh-mime-display): Update error message.

	* mh-seq.el: Require cleanup, and wrap compiler-shushing defvars
	with eval-when-compile.

	* mh-utils.el: Require cleanup, and wrap compiler-shushing defvars
	with eval-when-compile.
	(mh-clean-msg-header): Don't set after-change-functions to nil.
	(mh-replace-in-string): Remove. Create defsubst in mh-xemacs.el
	instead.
	
2006-01-07  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	* mh-customize.el: Updated Faces documentation in header.
	(mh-invisible-header-fields-internal): Add X-Lumos-SenderID,

	* mh-mime.el (mh-mml-tag-present-p): Update regexp to handle <mml>
	tags inserted by Gnus gnus-summary-mail-forward (closes SF
	#1399307).

	* mh-index.el (mh-mairix-execute-search): Fix symbol quote.

2006-01-03  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	* mh-alias.el (mh-alias-add-alias): Grand message and error string
	unification. Use single sentence if possible by using semicolon.
	Don't end message with punctuation. Don't need format with
	message. Quote messages as in docstrings: use `' around symbols,
	\" for option choices. Don't use quotes around %s.

	* mh-mime.el (mh-mime-save-parts): Ditto.

	* mh-seq.el (mh-read-seq, mh-read-range): Ditto.

	* mh-customize.el (mh-folder-msg-number): Snow is actually
	off-white on low color displays which turns to white when bold.
	This is unreadable on white backgrounds. Use snow with min-colors
	requirement. Use cyan on low-color displays.

	* mh-init.el (mh-defface-compat): On low-color displays, delete
	the high-color display rather than simply strip the min-colors
	requirement since the existing algorithm shadowed the desired
	display on low-color displays.

	* mh-alias.el (mh-alias-add-alias): Remove leading * from
	docstring.

2006-01-02  Bill Wohler  <wohler@newt.com>

	(mh-folder-font-lock-keywords): Use faces directly rather than
	-face variables. Use mh-scan-sent-to-me-sender-regexp instead of

	mh-folder-sent-to-me-hint and mh-folder-sent-to-me-sender instead
	of mh-folder-date-face and mh-folder-scan-format-face which were
	misleading.

	* mh-mime.el (mh-mime-security-button-face): Use faces directly

	Follow commenting conventions. Don't use ;;; form so much, except
	for headings. Precede headings with page feed. This was mostly
	already done, so I made it a convention. Did not update copyright
	on a couple of files since this was an insignificant change.
