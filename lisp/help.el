;;; Commentary:

;; This code implements GNU Emacs's built-in help system, the one invoked by
;; `M-x help-for-help'.

;;; Code:

;; Get the macro make-help-screen when this is compiled,
;; or run interpreted, but not when the compiled code is loaded.
(eval-when-compile (require 'help-macro))

;; This makes `with-output-to-temp-buffer' buffers use `help-mode'.
(add-hook 'temp-buffer-setup-hook 'help-mode-setup)
(add-hook 'temp-buffer-show-hook 'help-mode-finish)

;; `help-window-point-marker' is a marker you can move to a valid
;; position of the buffer shown in the help window in order to override
;; the standard positioning mechanism (`point-min') chosen by
;; `with-output-to-temp-buffer' and `with-temp-buffer-window'.
;; `with-help-window' has this point nowhere before exiting.  Currently
;; used by `view-lossage' to assert that the last keystrokes are always
;; visible.
