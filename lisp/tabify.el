;;; Commentary:

;; Commands to optimize spaces to tabs or expand tabs to spaces in a region
;; (`tabify' and `untabify').  The variable tab-width does the obvious.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun untabify (start end)
  "Convert all tabs in region to multiple spaces, preserving columns.
Called non-interactively, the region is specified by arguments
START and END, rather than by the position of point and mark.
The variable `tab-width' controls the spacing of tab stops."
  (interactive "r")
  (save-excursion
    (save-restriction
      (narrow-to-region (point-min) end)
      (goto-char start)
      (while (search-forward "\t" nil t)	; faster than re-search
	(let ((tab-beg (point))
	      (column (current-column))
	      (indent-tabs-mode nil))
	  (skip-chars-backward "\t" start)
	  (delete-region tab-beg (point))
	  (indent-to column))))))

;;;###autoload
(defun tabify (start end)
  "Convert multiple spaces in region to tabs when possible.
A group of spaces is partially replaced by tabs
when this can be done without changing the column they end at.
Called non-interactively, the region is specified by arguments
START and END, rather than by the position of point and mark.
The variable `tab-width' controls the spacing of tab stops."
  (interactive "r")
  (save-excursion
    (save-restriction
      ;; Include the beginning of the line in the narrowing
      ;; since otherwise it will throw off current-column.
      (goto-char start)
      (beginning-of-line)
      (narrow-to-region (point) end)
      (goto-char start)
      (while (re-search-forward "[ \t][ \t][ \t]*" nil t)
	(let ((column (current-column))
	      (indent-tabs-mode t))
	  (delete-region (match-beginning 0) (point))
	  (indent-to column))))))
