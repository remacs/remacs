  "Bind `standard-output' to BUFFER-OR-NAME, eval BODY, show the buffer.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must specify either a live buffer, or the name of
a buffer (if it does not exist, this macro creates it).

Make the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME empty before running
BODY and bind `standard-output' to that buffer, so that output
generated with `prin1' and similar functions in BODY goes into
that buffer.  Do not make that buffer current for running the
forms in BODY.  Use `with-current-buffer-window' instead if you
need to run BODY with that buffer current.

At the end of BODY, mark the specified buffer unmodified and
read-only, and display it in a window (but do not select it).
The display happens by calling `display-buffer' passing it the
ACTION argument.  If `temp-buffer-resize-mode' is enabled, the
corresponding window may be resized automatically.

Return the value returned by BODY, unless QUIT-FUNCTION specifies
a function.  In that case, run that function with two arguments -
the window showing the specified buffer and the value returned by
BODY - and return the value returned by that function.

If the buffer is displayed on a new frame, the window manager may
decide to select that frame.  In that case, it's usually a good
strategy if QUIT-FUNCTION selects the window showing the buffer
before reading any value from the minibuffer; for example, when
asking a `yes-or-no-p' question.

This runs the hook `temp-buffer-window-setup-hook' before BODY,
with the specified buffer temporarily current.  It runs the hook
`temp-buffer-window-show-hook' after displaying the buffer, with
that buffer temporarily current, and the window that was used to
display it temporarily selected.

This construct is similar to `with-output-to-temp-buffer' but,
neither runs `temp-buffer-setup-hook' which usually puts the
buffer in Help mode, nor `temp-buffer-show-function' (the ACTION
argument replaces this)."

DIRECTION must be one of `above', `below', `left' or `right'.
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.

Do not return a window whose `no-other-window' parameter is
non-nil.  If the nearest window's `no-other-window' parameter is
non-nil, try to find another window in the indicated direction.
If, however, the optional argument IGNORE is non-nil, return that
window even if its `no-other-window' parameter is non-nil.

Optional argument SIGN a negative number means to use the right
or bottom edge of WINDOW as reference position instead of
`window-point'.  SIGN a positive number means to use the left or
top edge of WINDOW as reference position.

Optional argument WRAP non-nil means to wrap DIRECTION around
frame borders.  This means to return for WINDOW at the top of the
frame and DIRECTION `above' the minibuffer window if the frame
has one, and a window at the bottom of the frame otherwise.

Optional argument MINI nil means to return the minibuffer window
if and only if it is currently active.  MINI non-nil means to
return the minibuffer window even when it's not active.  However,
if WRAP is non-nil, always act as if MINI were nil.

Return nil if no suitable window can be found."

;;; Windows and buffers.

;; buffer shall be buried or killed and (2) which buffer to show for
;; `switch-to-prev-buffer' and `switch-to-next-buffer'.

;; `prev-buffers' consists of <buffer, window-start, window-point>
;; triples.  The entries on this list are ordered by the time their
;; buffer has been removed from the window, the most recently removed
;; buffer's entry being first.  The window-start and window-point
;; components are `window-start' and `window-point' at the time the
;; buffer was removed from the window which implies that the entry must
;; be added when `set-window-buffer' removes the buffer from the window.

;; `next-buffers' is the list of buffers that have been replaced
;; recently by `switch-to-prev-buffer'.  These buffers are the least
;; preferred candidates of `switch-to-prev-buffer' and the preferred
;; candidates of `switch-to-next-buffer' to switch to.  This list is
;; reset to nil by any action changing the window's buffer with the
;; exception of `switch-to-prev-buffer' and `switch-to-next-buffer'.
;; `switch-to-prev-buffer' pushes the buffer it just replaced on it,
;; `switch-to-next-buffer' pops the last pushed buffer from it.

;; Both `prev-buffers' and `next-buffers' may reference killed buffers
;; if such a buffer was killed while the window was hidden within a
;; window configuration.  Such killed buffers get removed whenever
;; `switch-to-prev-buffer' or `switch-to-next-buffer' encounter them.

BUFFER-OR-NAME must be a buffer or the name of an existing

or nil if no such window is found.

Optional argument ACTION, if non-nil, should specify a display
action.  Its form is described below.

Optional argument FRAME, if non-nil, acts like an additional
ALIST entry (reusable-frames . FRAME) to the action list of ACTION,
specifying the frame(s) to search for a window that is already
displaying the buffer.  See `display-buffer-reuse-window'.

If ACTION is non-nil, it should have the form (FUNCTION . ALIST),
where FUNCTION is either a function or a list of functions, and
ALIST is an arbitrary association list (alist).

Each such FUNCTION should accept two arguments: the buffer to
display and an alist.  Based on those arguments, it should
display the buffer and return the window.  If the caller is
prepared to handle the case of not displaying the buffer
and returning nil from `display-buffer' it should pass
\(allow-no-window . t) as an element of the ALIST.

The `display-buffer' function builds a function list and an alist
by combining the functions and alists specified in
`display-buffer-overriding-action', `display-buffer-alist', the
ACTION argument, `display-buffer-base-action', and
`display-buffer-fallback-action' (in order).  Then it calls each
function in the combined function list in turn, passing the
buffer as the first argument and the combined alist as the second
argument, until one of the functions returns non-nil.

If ACTION is nil, the function list and the alist are built using
only the other variables mentioned above.

Available action functions include:
 `display-buffer-same-window'
 `display-buffer-reuse-window'
 `display-buffer-pop-up-frame'
 `display-buffer-in-child-frame'
 `display-buffer-pop-up-window'
 `display-buffer-in-previous-window'
 `display-buffer-use-some-window'
 `display-buffer-use-some-frame'

Recognized alist entries include:

 `inhibit-same-window' -- A non-nil value prevents the same
                          window from being used for display.

 `inhibit-switch-frame' -- A non-nil value prevents any other
                           frame from being raised or selected,
                           even if the window is displayed there.

 `reusable-frames' -- Value specifies frame(s) to search for a
                      window that already displays the buffer.
                      See `display-buffer-reuse-window'.

 `pop-up-frame-parameters' -- Value specifies an alist of frame
                              parameters to give a new frame, if
                              one is created.

 `window-height' -- Value specifies either an integer (the number
    of lines of a new window), a floating point number (the
    fraction of a new window with respect to the height of the
    frame's root window) or a function to be called with one
    argument - a new window.  The function is supposed to adjust
    the height of the window; its return value is ignored.
    Suitable functions are `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer'
    and `fit-window-to-buffer'.

 `window-width' -- Value specifies either an integer (the number
    of columns of a new window), a floating point number (the
    fraction of a new window with respect to the width of the
    frame's root window) or a function to be called with one
    argument - a new window.  The function is supposed to adjust
    the width of the window; its return value is ignored.

 `allow-no-window' -- A non-nil value indicates readiness for the case
    of not displaying the buffer and FUNCTION can safely return
    a non-window value to suppress displaying.

 `preserve-size' -- Value should be either (t . nil) to
    preserve the width of the window, (nil . t) to preserve its
    height or (t . t) to preserve both.

 `window-parameters' -- Value specifies an alist of window
                        parameters to give the chosen window.

The ACTION argument to `display-buffer' can also have a non-nil
and non-list value.  This means to display the buffer in a window
other than the selected one, even if it is already displayed in
the selected window.  If called interactively with a prefix
argument, ACTION is t."
