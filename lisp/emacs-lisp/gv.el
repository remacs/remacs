;;; Commentary:

;; This is a re-implementation of the setf machinery using a different
;; underlying approach than the one used earlier in CL, which was based on
;; define-setf-expander.
;; `define-setf-expander' makes every "place-expander" return a 5-tuple
;;   (VARS VALUES STORES GETTER SETTER)
;; where STORES is a list with a single variable (Common-Lisp allows multiple
;; variables for use with multiple-return-values, but this is rarely used and
;; not applicable to Elisp).
;; It basically says that GETTER is an expression that returns the place's
;; value, and (lambda STORES SETTER) is an expression that assigns the value(s)
;; passed to that function to the place, and that you need to wrap the whole
;; thing within a `(let* ,(zip VARS VALUES) ...).
;;
;; Instead, we use here a higher-order approach: instead
;; of a 5-tuple, a place-expander returns a function.
;; If you think about types, the old approach return things of type
;;    {vars: List Var, values: List Exp,
;;     stores: List Var, getter: Exp, setter: Exp}
;; whereas the new approach returns a function of type
;;    (do: ((getter: Exp, setter: ((store: Exp) -> Exp)) -> Exp)) -> Exp.
;; You can get the new function from the old 5-tuple with something like:
;;    (lambda (do)
;;       `(let* ,(zip VARS VALUES)
;;          (funcall do GETTER (lambda ,STORES ,SETTER))))
;; You can't easily do the reverse, because this new approach is more
;; expressive than the old one, so we can't provide a backward-compatible
;; get-setf-method.
;;
;; While it may seem intimidating for people not used to higher-order
;; functions, you will quickly see that its use (especially with the
;; `gv-letplace' macro) is actually much easier and more elegant than the old
;; approach which is clunky and often leads to unreadable code.

;; Food for thought: the syntax of places does not actually conflict with the
;; pcase patterns.  The `cons' gv works just like a `(,a . ,b) pcase
;; pattern, and actually the `logand' gv is even closer since it should
;; arguably fail when trying to set a value outside of the mask.
;; Generally, places are used for destructors (gethash, aref, car, ...)
;; whereas pcase patterns are used for constructors (backquote, constants,
;; vectors, ...).

;;; Code:

(require 'macroexp)

;; What we call a "gvar" is basically a function of type "(getter * setter ->
;; code) -> code", where "getter" is code and setter is "code -> code".
