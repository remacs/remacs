;;; Commentary:

;; The cl-defstruct macro is full of circularities, since it uses the
;; cl-structure-class type (and its accessors) which is defined with itself,
;; and it setups a default parent (cl-structure-object) which is also defined
;; with cl-defstruct, and to make things more interesting, the class of
;; cl-structure-object is of course an object of type cl-structure-class while
;; cl-structure-class's parent is cl-structure-object.
;; Furthermore, the code generated by cl-defstruct generally assumes that the
;; parent will be loaded when the child is loaded.  But at the same time, the
;; expectation is that structs defined with cl-defstruct do not need cl-lib at
;; run-time, which means that the `cl-structure-object' parent can't be in
;; cl-lib but should be preloaded.  So here's this preloaded circular setup.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-macs))  ;For cl--struct-class.

;; The `assert' macro from the cl package signals
;; `cl-assertion-failed' at runtime so always define it.
