;;; Commentary:

;; The Emacs Lisp byte compiler.  This crunches lisp source into a sort
;; of p-code (`lapcode') which takes up less space and can be interpreted
;; faster.  [`LAP' == `Lisp Assembly Program'.]
;; The user entry points are byte-compile-file and byte-recompile-directory.

;;; Todo:

;; - Turn "not bound at runtime" functions into autoloads.

;;; Code:

;; ========================================================================
;; Entry points:
;;	byte-recompile-directory, byte-compile-file,
;;      byte-recompile-file,
;;     batch-byte-compile, batch-byte-recompile-directory,
;;	byte-compile, compile-defun,
;;	display-call-tree
;; (byte-compile-buffer and byte-compile-and-load-file were turned off
;;  because they are not terribly useful and get in the way of completion.)

;; This version of the byte compiler has the following improvements:
;;  + optimization of compiled code:
;;    - removal of unreachable code;
;;    - removal of calls to side-effectless functions whose return-value
;;      is unused;
;;    - compile-time evaluation of safe constant forms, such as (consp nil)
;;      and (ash 1 6);
;;    - open-coding of literal lambdas;
;;    - peephole optimization of emitted code;
;;    - trivial functions are left uncompiled for speed.
;;  + support for inline functions;
;;  + compile-time evaluation of arbitrary expressions;
;;  + compile-time warning messages for:
;;    - functions being redefined with incompatible arglists;
;;    - functions being redefined as macros, or vice-versa;
;;    - functions or macros defined multiple times in the same file;
;;    - functions being called with the incorrect number of arguments;
;;    - functions being called which are not defined globally, in the
;;      file, or as autoloads;
;;    - assignment and reference of undeclared free variables;
;;    - various syntax errors;
;;  + correct compilation of nested defuns, defmacros, defvars and defsubsts;
;;  + correct compilation of top-level uses of macros;
;;  + the ability to generate a histogram of functions called.

;; User customization variables: M-x customize-group bytecomp

;; New Features:
;;
;;  o	The form `defsubst' is just like `defun', except that the function
;;	generated will be open-coded in compiled code which uses it.  This
;;	means that no function call will be generated, it will simply be
;;	spliced in.  Lisp functions calls are very slow, so this can be a
;;	big win.
;;
;;	You can generally accomplish the same thing with `defmacro', but in
;;	that case, the defined procedure can't be used as an argument to
;;	mapcar, etc.
;;
;;  o	You can also open-code one particular call to a function without
;;	open-coding all calls.  Use the 'inline' form to do this, like so:
;;
;;		(inline (foo 1 2 3))	;; `foo' will be open-coded
;;	or...
;;		(inline			;;  `foo' and `baz' will be
;;		 (foo 1 2 3 (bar 5))	;; open-coded, but `bar' will not.
;;		 (baz 0))
;;
;;  o	It is possible to open-code a function in the same file it is defined
;;	in without having to load that file before compiling it.  The
;;	byte-compiler has been modified to remember function definitions in
;;	the compilation environment in the same way that it remembers macro
;;	definitions.
;;
;;  o  Forms like ((lambda ...) ...) are open-coded.
;;
;;  o  The form `eval-when-compile' is like progn, except that the body
;;     is evaluated at compile-time.  When it appears at top-level, this
;;     is analogous to the Common Lisp idiom (eval-when (compile) ...).
;;     When it does not appear at top-level, it is similar to the
;;     Common Lisp #. reader macro (but not in interpreted code).
;;
;;  o  The form `eval-and-compile' is similar to eval-when-compile, but
;;	the whole form is evalled both at compile-time and at run-time.
;;
;;  o  The command compile-defun is analogous to eval-defun.
;;
;;  o  If you run byte-compile-file on a filename which is visited in a
;;     buffer, and that buffer is modified, you are asked whether you want
;;     to save the buffer before compiling.
;;
;;  o  byte-compiled files now start with the string `;ELC'.
;;     Some versions of `file' can be customized to recognize that.

;;; lapcode generator
;;
;; the byte-compiler now does source -> lapcode -> bytecode instead of
;; source -> bytecode, because it's a lot easier to make optimizations
;; on lapcode than on bytecode.
;;
;; Elements of the lapcode list are of the form (<instruction> . <parameter>)
;; where instruction is a symbol naming a byte-code instruction,
;; and parameter is an argument to that instruction, if any.
;;
;; The instruction can be the pseudo-op TAG, which means that this position
;; in the instruction stream is a target of a goto.  (car PARAMETER) will be
;; the PC for this location, and the whole instruction "(TAG pc)" will be the
;; parameter for some goto op.
;;
;; If the operation is varbind, varref, varset or push-constant, then the
;; parameter is (variable/constant . index_in_constant_vector).
;;
;; First, the source code is macroexpanded and optimized in various ways.
;; Then the resultant code is compiled into lapcode.  Another set of
;; optimizations are then run over the lapcode.  Then the variables and
;; constants referenced by the lapcode are collected and placed in the
;; constants-vector.  (This happens now so that variables referenced by dead
;; code don't consume space.)  And finally, the lapcode is transformed into
;; compacted byte-code.
;;
;; A distinction is made between variables and constants because the variable-
;; referencing instructions are more sensitive to the variables being near the
;; front of the constants-vector than the constant-referencing instructions.
;; Also, this lets us notice references to free variables.

;; raw source code.  This is used for warning and error messages.
;;
;; The function should be called for most occurrences of symbols in
;; the forms being compiled, strictly in the order they occur in the
;; source code.  It should never be called twice for any single
;; occurrence, and should not be called for symbols generated by the
;; byte compiler itself.
;;
;; The function works by scanning the elements in the alist
;; `read-symbol-positions-list' for the next match for the symbol
;; after the current value of `byte-compile-last-position', setting
;; that variable to the match's character position, then deleting the
;; matching element from the list.  Thus the new value for
;; `byte-compile-last-position' is later than the old value unless,
;; perhaps, ALLOW-PREVIOUS is non-nil.
