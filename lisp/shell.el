;;; This file defines a a shell-in-a-buffer package (shell mode) built
;;; on top of comint mode.  This is actually cmushell with things
;;; renamed to replace its counterpart in Emacs 18.  cmushell is more
;;; featureful, robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.

;;; Since this mode is built on top of the general command-interpreter-in-
;;; a-buffer mode (comint mode), it shares a common base functionality, 
;;; and a common set of bindings, with all modes derived from comint mode.
;;; This makes these modes easier to use.

;;; For documentation on the functionality provided by comint mode, and
;;; the hooks available for customising it, see the file comint.el.
;;; For further information on shell mode, see the comments below.

;;; Needs fixin:
;;; When sending text from a source file to a subprocess, the process-mark can 
;;; move off the window, so you can lose sight of the process interactions.
;;; Maybe I should ensure the process mark is in the window when I send
;;; text to the process? Switch selectable?

(defun shell-mode ()
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior shell.
Return after the end of the process' output sends the text from the 
    end of process to the end of the current line.
Return before end of process output copies the current line (except
    for the prompt) to the end of the buffer and sends it.
\\[send-invisible] reads a line of text without echoing it, and sends it to
    the shell.  This is useful for entering passwords.  Or, add the function
    `comint-watch-for-password-prompt' to `comint-output-filter-functions'.

If you want to make multiple shell buffers, rename the `*shell*' buffer
using \\[rename-buffer] or \\[rename-uniquely] and start a new shell.

If you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]
to continue it.

`cd', `pushd' and `popd' commands given to the shell are watched by Emacs to
keep this buffer's default directory the same as the shell's working directory.
While directory tracking is enabled, the shell's working directory is displayed
by \\[list-buffers] or \\[mouse-buffer-menu] in the `File' field.
\\[dirs] queries the shell and resyncs Emacs' idea of what the current 
    directory stack is.
\\[dirtrack-toggle] turns directory tracking on and off.

\\{shell-mode-map}
Customization: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`shell-mode-hook' (in that order).  Before each input, the hooks on
`comint-input-filter-functions' are run.  After each shell output, the hooks
on `comint-output-filter-functions' are run.

Variables `shell-cd-regexp', `shell-pushd-regexp' and `shell-popd-regexp'
are used to match their respective commands, while `shell-pushd-tohome',
`shell-pushd-dextract' and `shell-pushd-dunique' control the behavior of the
relevant command.

Variables `comint-completion-autolist', `comint-completion-addsuffix',
`comint-completion-recexact' and `comint-completion-fignore' control the
behavior of file name, command name and variable name completion.  Variable
`shell-completion-execonly' controls the behavior of command name completion.
Variable `shell-completion-fignore' is used to initialise the value of
`comint-completion-fignore'.

Variables `comint-input-ring-file-name' and `comint-input-autoexpand' control
the initialisation of the input ring history, and history expansion.

Variables `comint-output-filter-functions', a hook, and
`comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input' and `comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output'
control whether input and output cause the window to scroll to the end of the

;;; Directory tracking
;;; ===========================================================================
;;; This code provides the shell mode input sentinel
;;;     SHELL-DIRECTORY-TRACKER
;;; that tracks cd, pushd, and popd commands issued to the shell, and
;;; changes the current directory of the shell buffer accordingly.
;;;
;;; This is basically a fragile hack, although it's more accurate than
;;; the version in Emacs 18's shell.el. It has the following failings:
;;; 1. It doesn't know about the cdpath shell variable.
;;; 2. It cannot infallibly deal with command sequences, though it does well
;;;    with these and with ignoring commands forked in another shell with ()s.
;;; 3. More generally, any complex command is going to throw it. Otherwise,
;;;    you'd have to build an entire shell interpreter in emacs lisp.  Failing
;;;    that, there's no way to catch shell commands where cd's are buried
;;;    inside conditional expressions, aliases, and so forth.
;;;
;;; The whole approach is a crock. Shell aliases mess it up. File sourcing
;;; messes it up. You run other processes under the shell; these each have
;;; separate working directories, and some have commands for manipulating
;;; their w.d.'s (e.g., the lcd command in ftp). Some of these programs have
;;; commands that do *not* affect the current w.d. at all, but look like they
;;; do (e.g., the cd command in ftp).  In shells that allow you job
;;; control, you can switch between jobs, all having different w.d.'s. So
;;; simply saying %3 can shift your w.d..
;;;
;;; The solution is to relax, not stress out about it, and settle for
;;; a hack that works pretty well in typical circumstances. Remember
;;; that a half-assed solution is more in keeping with the spirit of Unix, 
;;; anyway. Blech.
;;;
;;; One good hack not implemented here for users of programmable shells
;;; is to program up the shell w.d. manipulation commands to output
;;; a coded command sequence to the tty. Something like
;;;     ESC | <cwd> |
;;; where <cwd> is the new current working directory. Then trash the
;;; directory tracking machinery currently used in this package, and
;;; replace it with a process filter that watches for and strips out
;;; these messages.
