  "Minor mode to distinguish hard and soft newlines.
When active, the functions `newline' and `open-line' add the
text-property `hard' to newlines that they insert, and a line is
only considered as a candidate to match `paragraph-start' or
`paragraph-separate' if it follows a hard newline.

Prefix argument says to turn mode on if positive, off if negative.
When the mode is turned on, if there are newlines in the buffer but no hard
newlines, ask the user whether to mark as hard any newlines preceeding a
`paragraph-start' line.  From a program, second arg INSERT specifies whether
to do this; it can be `never' to change nothing, t or `always' to force
marking, `guess' to try to do the right thing with no questions, nil
or anything else to ask the user.

Newlines not marked hard are called \"soft\", and are always internal
to paragraphs.  The fill functions insert and delete only soft newlines."

This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily
the beginning of the line, so it should never use \"^\" as an anchor.  This
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally well within a region
of text indented by a margin setting.

The variable `paragraph-separate' specifies how to distinguish
lines that start paragraphs from lines that separate them.

hard newline are considered to match."
