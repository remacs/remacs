;;; Commentary:

;; This mode provides syntax highlighting for Less CSS files
;; (http://lesscss.org/), plus optional support for compilation of
;; .less files to .css files at the time they are saved: use
;; `less-css-compile-at-save' to enable this.
;;
;; Command line utility "lessc" is required if setting
;; `less-css-compile-at-save' to t.  To install "lessc" using the
;; Node.js package manager, run "npm install less".
;;
;; Also make sure the "lessc" executable is in Emacs' PATH, example:
;; (push (expand-file-name "~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin") exec-path)
;; or customize `less-css-lessc-command' to point to your "lessc"
;; executable.
;;
;; We target lessc >= 1.4.0, and thus use the `--no-color' flag by
;; default.  You may want to adjust `less-css-lessc-options' for
;; compatibility with older versions.
;;
;; `less-css-mode' is derived from `css-mode', and indentation of
;; nested blocks may not work correctly with versions of `css-mode'
;; other than that bundled with recent Emacs.
;;
;; You can specify per-file values for `less-css-compile-at-save',
;; `less-css-output-file-name' or `less-css-output-directory' using a
;; variables header at the top of your .less file, e.g.:
;;
;; // -*- less-css-compile-at-save: t; less-css-output-directory: "../css" -*-
;;
;; Alternatively, you can use directory local variables to set the
;; default value of `less-css-output-directory' for your project.
;;
;; In the case of files which are included in other .less files, you
;; may want to trigger the compilation of a "master" .less file on
;; save: you can accomplish this with `less-css-input-file-name',
;; which is probably best set using directory local variables.
;;
;; If you don't need CSS output but would like to be warned of any
;; syntax errors in your .less source, consider using `flymake-less':
;; https://github.com/purcell/flymake-less.
