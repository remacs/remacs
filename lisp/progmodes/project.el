;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains generic infrastructure for dealing with
;; projects, some utility functions, and commands using that
;; infrastructure.
;;
;; The goal is to make it easier for Lisp programs to operate on the
;; current project, without having to know which package handles
;; detection of that project type, parsing its config files, etc.
;;
;; NOTE: The project API is still experimental and can change in major,
;; backward-incompatible ways.  Everyone is encouraged to try it, and
;; report to us any problems or use cases we hadn't anticipated, by
;; sending an email to emacs-devel, or `M-x report-emacs-bug'.
;;
;; Infrastructure:
;;
;; Function `project-current', to determine the current project
;; instance, and 3 (at the moment) generic functions that act on it.
;; This list is to be extended in future versions.
;;
;; Utils:
;;
;; `project-combine-directories' and `project-subtract-directories',
;; mainly for use in the abovementioned generics' implementations.
;;
;; Commands:
;;
;; `project-find-regexp' and `project-or-external-find-regexp' use the
;; current API, and thus will work in any project that has an adapter.

;;; TODO:

;; * Reliably cache the list of files in the project, probably using
;;   filenotify.el (if supported) to invalidate.  And avoiding caching
;;   if it's not available (manual cache invalidation is not nice).
;;
;; * Allow the backend to override the file-listing logic?  Maybe also
;;   to delegate file name completion to an external tool.
;;
;; * Build tool related functionality.  Start with a `project-build'
;;   command, which should provide completions on tasks to run, and
;;   maybe allow entering some additional arguments.  This might
;;   be handled better with a separate API, though.  Then we won't
;;   force every project backend to be aware of the build tool(s) the
;;   project is using.
;;
;; * Command to (re)build the tag files in all project roots.  To that
;;   end, we might need to add a way to provide file whitelist
;;   wildcards for each root to limit etags to certain files (in
;;   addition to the blacklist provided by ignores), and/or allow
;;   specifying additional tag regexps.
;;
;; * UI for the user to be able to pick the current project for the
;;   whole Emacs session, independent of the current directory.  Or,
;;   in the more advanced case, open a set of projects, and have some
;;   project-related commands to use them all.  E.g., have a command
;;   to search for a regexp across all open projects.  Provide a
;;   history of projects that were opened in the past (storing it as a
;;   list of directories should suffice).
;;
;; * Support for project-local variables: a UI to edit them, and a
;;   utility function to retrieve a value.  Probably useless without
;;   support in various built-in commands.  In the API, we might get
;;   away with only adding a `project-configuration-directory' method,
;;   defaulting to the project root the current file/buffer is in.
;;   And prompting otherwise.  How to best mix that with backends that
;;   want to set/provide certain variables themselves, is up for
;;   discussion.

;; FIXME: Using the current approach, major modes are supposed to set
;; this variable to a buffer-local value.  So we don't have access to
;; the "external roots" of language A from buffers of language B, which
;; seems desirable in multi-language projects, at least for some
;; potential uses, like "jump to a file in project or external dirs".
;;
;; We could add a second argument to this function: a file extension,
;; or a language name.  Some projects will know the set of languages
;; used in them; for others, like VC-based projects, we'll need
;; auto-detection.  I see two options:
;;
;; - That could be implemented as a separate second hook, with a
;;   list of functions that return file extensions.
;;
;; - This variable will be turned into a hook with "append" semantics,
;;   and each function in it will perform auto-detection when passed
;;   nil instead of an actual file extension.  Then this hook will, in
;;   general, be modified globally, and not from major mode functions.
;;
;; The second option seems simpler, but the first one has the
;; advantage that the user could override the list of languages used
;; in a project via a directory-local variable, thus skipping
;; languages they're not working on personally (in a big project), or
;; working around problems in language detection (the detection logic
;; might be imperfect for the project in question, or it might work
;; too slowly for the user's taste).
