;;; Commentary:

;; The functions which have docstring documentation can be considered
;; part of an API which other packages can use in CC Mode buffers.
;; Otoh, undocumented functions and functions with the documentation
;; in comments are considered purely internal and can change semantics
;; or even disappear in the future.
;;
;; (This policy applies to CC Mode as a whole, not just this file.  It
;; probably also applies to many other Emacs packages, but here it's
;; clearly spelled out.)

  "Move to the start of the current statement or declaration, or to
the previous one if already at the beginning of one.  Only
statements/declarations on the same level are considered, i.e. don't
move into or out of sexps (not even normal expression parentheses).

Stop at statement continuations like \"else\", \"catch\", \"finally\"
and the \"while\" in \"do ... while\" if the start point is within
them.  If starting at such a continuation, move to the corresponding
statement start.  If at the beginning of a statement, move to the
closest containing statement if there is any.  This might also stop at
a continuation clause.

Labels are treated as separate statements if IGNORE-LABELS is non-nil.
The function is not overly intelligent in telling labels from other
uses of colons; if used outside a statement context it might trip up
on e.g. inherit colons, so IGNORE-LABELS should be used then.  There
should be no such mistakes in a statement context, however.

Macros are ignored unless point is within one, in which case the
content of the macro is treated as normal code.  Aside from any normal
statement starts found in it, stop at the first token of the content
in the macro, i.e. the expression of an \"#if\" or the start of the
definition in a \"#define\".  Also stop at start of macros before
leaving them.

Return 'label if stopped at a label, 'same if stopped at the beginning
of the current statement, 'up if stepped to a containing statement,
'previous if stepped to a preceding statement, 'beginning if stepped
from a statement continuation clause to its start clause, or 'macro if
stepped to a macro start.  Note that 'same and not 'label is returned
if stopped at the same label without crossing the colon character.

LIM may be given to limit the search.  If the search hits the limit,
point will be left at the closest following token, or at the start
position if that is less ('same is returned in this case).

NOERROR turns off error logging to `c-parsing-error'.

Normally only ';' is considered to delimit statements, but if
COMMA-DELIM is non-nil then ',' is treated likewise."

  ;; The bulk of this function is a pushdown automaton that looks at
  ;; statement boundaries and the tokens in c-opt-block-stmt-key.
  ;;
  ;; Note: The position of a boundary is the following token.
  ;;
  ;; Begin with current token, stop when stack is empty and the
  ;; position has been moved.

  ;;   "else": Push state, goto state `else':
  ;;     boundary: Goto state `else-boundary':

  ;;       boundary: Error, pop state.
  ;;       other: See common state.
  ;;     other: Error, pop state, retry token.
  ;;   "while": Push state, goto state `while':
  ;;     boundary: Save position, goto state `while-boundary':
  ;;       "do": Pop state.
  ;;       boundary: Restore position if it's not at start, pop state.
  ;;       other: See common state.
  ;;     other: Pop state, retry token.
