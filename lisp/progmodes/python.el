;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing Python files with some fontification and
;; indentation bits extracted from original Dave Love's python.el
;; found in GNU/Emacs.

;; Implements Syntax highlighting, Indentation, Movement, Shell
;; interaction, Shell completion, Shell virtualenv support, Pdb
;; tracking, Symbol completion, Skeletons, FFAP, Code Check, Eldoc,
;; Imenu.

;; Syntax highlighting: Fontification of code is provided and supports
;; python's triple quoted strings properly.

;; Indentation: Automatic indentation with indentation cycling is
;; provided, it allows you to navigate different available levels of
;; indentation by hitting <tab> several times.  Also electric-indent-mode
;; is supported such that when inserting a colon the current line is
;; dedented automatically if needed.

;; Movement: `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun' functions are
;; properly implemented.  There are also specialized
;; `forward-sentence' and `backward-sentence' replacements called
;; `python-nav-forward-block', `python-nav-backward-block'
;; respectively which navigate between beginning of blocks of code.
;; Extra functions `python-nav-forward-statement',
;; `python-nav-backward-statement',
;; `python-nav-beginning-of-statement', `python-nav-end-of-statement',
;; `python-nav-beginning-of-block', `python-nav-end-of-block' and
;; `python-nav-if-name-main' are included but no bound to any key.  At
;; last but not least the specialized `python-nav-forward-sexp' allows
;; easy navigation between code blocks.  If you prefer `cc-mode'-like
;; `forward-sexp' movement, setting `forward-sexp-function' to nil is
;; enough, You can do that using the `python-mode-hook':

;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
;;           (lambda () (setq forward-sexp-function nil)))

;; Shell interaction: is provided and allows opening Python shells
;; inside Emacs and executing any block of code of your current buffer
;; in that inferior Python process.

;; Besides that only the standard CPython (2.x and 3.x) shell and
;; IPython are officially supported out of the box, the interaction
;; should support any other readline based Python shells as well
;; (e.g. Jython and Pypy have been reported to work).  You can change
;; your default interpreter and commandline arguments by setting the
;; `python-shell-interpreter' and `python-shell-interpreter-args'
;; variables.  This example enables IPython globally:

;; (setq python-shell-interpreter "ipython"
;;       python-shell-interpreter-args "-i")

;; Using the "console" subcommand to start IPython in server-client
;; mode is known to fail intermittently due a bug on IPython itself
;; (see URL `http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=18052#27').
;; There seems to be a race condition in the IPython server (A.K.A
;; kernel) when code is sent while it is still initializing, sometimes
;; causing the shell to get stalled.  With that said, if an IPython
;; kernel is already running, "console --existing" seems to work fine.

;; Running IPython on Windows needs more tweaking.  The way you should
;; set `python-shell-interpreter' and `python-shell-interpreter-args'
;; is as follows (of course you need to modify the paths according to
;; your system):

;; (setq python-shell-interpreter "C:\\Python27\\python.exe"
;;       python-shell-interpreter-args
;;       "-i C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ipython-script.py")

;; Missing or delayed output used to happen due to differences between
;; Operating Systems' pipe buffering (e.g. CPython 3.3.4 in Windows 7.
;; See URL `http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=17304').  To
;; avoid this, the `python-shell-unbuffered' defaults to non-nil and
;; controls whether `python-shell-calculate-process-environment'
;; should set the "PYTHONUNBUFFERED" environment variable on startup:
;; See URL `https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-u'.

;; The interaction relies upon having prompts for input (e.g. ">>> "
;; and "... " in standard Python shell) and output (e.g. "Out[1]: " in
;; IPython) detected properly.  Failing that Emacs may hang but, in
;; the case that happens, you can recover with \\[keyboard-quit].  To
;; avoid this issue, a two-step prompt autodetection mechanism is
;; provided: the first step is manual and consists of a collection of
;; regular expressions matching common prompts for Python shells
;; stored in `python-shell-prompt-input-regexps' and
;; `python-shell-prompt-output-regexps', and dir-local friendly vars
;; `python-shell-prompt-regexp', `python-shell-prompt-block-regexp',
;; `python-shell-prompt-output-regexp' which are appended to the
;; former automatically when a shell spawns; the second step is
;; automatic and depends on the `python-shell-prompt-detect' helper
;; function.  See its docstring for details on global variables that
;; modify its behavior.

;; Shell completion: hitting tab will try to complete the current
;; word.  Shell completion is implemented in such way that if you
;; change the `python-shell-interpreter' it should be possible to
;; integrate custom logic to calculate completions.  To achieve this
;; you just need to set `python-shell-completion-setup-code' and
;; `python-shell-completion-string-code'.  The default provided code,
;; enables autocompletion for both CPython and IPython (and ideally
;; any readline based Python shell).  This code depends on the
;; readline module, so if you are using some Operating System that
;; bundles Python without it (like Windows), installing pyreadline
;; from URL `http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro' should
;; suffice.  To troubleshoot why you are not getting any completions
;; you can try the following in your Python shell:

;; >>> import readline, rlcompleter

;; If you see an error, then you need to either install pyreadline or
;; setup custom code that avoids that dependency.

;; Shell virtualenv support: The shell also contains support for
;; virtualenvs and other special environment modifications thanks to
;; `python-shell-process-environment' and `python-shell-exec-path'.
;; These two variables allows you to modify execution paths and
;; environment variables to make easy for you to setup virtualenv rules
;; or behavior modifications when running shells.  Here is an example
;; of how to make shell processes to be run using the /path/to/env/
;; virtualenv:

;; (setq python-shell-process-environment
;;       (list
;;        (format "PATH=%s" (mapconcat
;;                           'identity
;;                           (reverse
;;                            (cons (getenv "PATH")
;;                                  '("/path/to/env/bin/")))
;;                           ":"))
;;        "VIRTUAL_ENV=/path/to/env/"))
;; (python-shell-exec-path . ("/path/to/env/bin/"))

;; Since the above is cumbersome and can be programmatically
;; calculated, the variable `python-shell-virtualenv-path' is
;; provided.  When this variable is set with the path of the
;; virtualenv to use, `process-environment' and `exec-path' get proper
;; values in order to run shells inside the specified virtualenv.  So
;; the following will achieve the same as the previous example:

;; (setq python-shell-virtualenv-path "/path/to/env/")

;; Also the `python-shell-extra-pythonpaths' variable have been
;; introduced as simple way of adding paths to the PYTHONPATH without
;; affecting existing values.

;; Pdb tracking: when you execute a block of code that contains some
;; call to pdb (or ipdb) it will prompt the block of code and will
;; follow the execution of pdb marking the current line with an arrow.

;; Symbol completion: you can complete the symbol at point.  It uses
;; the shell completion in background so you should run
;; `python-shell-send-buffer' from time to time to get better results.

;; Skeletons: 6 skeletons are provided for simple inserting of class,
;; def, for, if, try and while.  These skeletons are integrated with
;; abbrev.  If you have `abbrev-mode' activated and
;; `python-skeleton-autoinsert' is set to t, then whenever you type
;; the name of any of those defined and hit SPC, they will be
;; automatically expanded.  As an alternative you can use the defined
;; skeleton commands: `python-skeleton-class', `python-skeleton-def'
;; `python-skeleton-for', `python-skeleton-if', `python-skeleton-try'
;; and `python-skeleton-while'.

;; FFAP: You can find the filename for a given module when using ffap
;; out of the box.  This feature needs an inferior python shell
;; running.

;; Code check: Check the current file for errors with `python-check'
;; using the program defined in `python-check-command'.

;; Eldoc: returns documentation for object at point by using the
;; inferior python subprocess to inspect its documentation.  As you
;; might guessed you should run `python-shell-send-buffer' from time
;; to time to get better results too.

;; Imenu: There are two index building functions to be used as
;; `imenu-create-index-function': `python-imenu-create-index' (the
;; default one, builds the alist in form of a tree) and
;; `python-imenu-create-flat-index'.  See also
;; `python-imenu-format-item-label-function',
;; `python-imenu-format-parent-item-label-function',
;; `python-imenu-format-parent-item-jump-label-function' variables for
;; changing the way labels are formatted in the tree version.

;; If you used python-mode.el you may miss auto-indentation when
;; inserting newlines.  To achieve the same behavior you have two
;; options:

;; 1) Enable the minor-mode `electric-indent-mode' (enabled by
;;    default) and use RET.  If this mode is disabled use
;;    `newline-and-indent', bound to C-j.

;; 2) Add the following hook in your .emacs:

;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
;;   #'(lambda ()
;;       (define-key python-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))

;; I'd recommend the first one since you'll get the same behavior for
;; all modes out-of-the-box.

;;; Installation:

;; Add this to your .emacs:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
;; (require 'python)

;;; TODO:
