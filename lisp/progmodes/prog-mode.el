;;; Commentary:

;; This major mode is mostly intended as a parent of other programming
;; modes.  All major modes for programming languages should derive from this
;; mode so that users can put generic customization on prog-mode-hook.

(defvar prog-indentation-context nil
  "When non-nil, provides context for indenting embedded code chunks.

There are languages where part of the code is actually written in
a sub language, e.g., a Yacc/Bison or ANTLR grammar also consists
of plain C code.  This variable enables the major mode of the
main language to use the indentation engine of the sub-mode for
lines in code chunks written in the sub-mode's language.

When a major mode of such a main language decides to delegate the
indentation of a line/region to the indentation engine of the sub
mode, it should bind this variable to non-nil around the call.

The non-nil value should be a list of the form:

   (FIRST-COLUMN (START . END) PREVIOUS-CHUNKS)

FIRST-COLUMN is the column the indentation engine of the sub-mode
should use for top-level language constructs inside the code
chunk (instead of 0).

START and END specify the region of the code chunk.  END can be
nil, which stands for the value of `point-max'.  The function
`prog-widen' uses this to restore restrictions imposed by the
sub-mode's indentation engine.

PREVIOUS-CHUNKS, if non-nil, provides the indentation engine of
the sub-mode with the virtual context of the code chunk.  Valid
values are:

 - A string containing text which the indentation engine can
   consider as standing in front of the code chunk.  To cache the
   string's calculated syntactic information for repeated calls
   with the same string, the sub-mode can add text-properties to
   the string.

   A typical use case is for grammars with code chunks which are
   to be indented like function bodies -- the string would contain
   the corresponding function preamble.

 - A function, to be called with the start position of the current
   chunk.  It should return either the region of the previous chunk
   as (PREV-START . PREV-END), or nil if there is no previous chunk.

   A typical use case are literate programming sources -- the
   function would successively return the previous code chunks.")
