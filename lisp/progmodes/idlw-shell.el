;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is for IDL version 4 or later.  It should work on Emacs
;; or XEmacs version 19 or later.

;; Runs IDL as an inferior process of Emacs, much like the emacs
;; `shell' or `telnet' commands.  Provides command history and
;; searching.  Provides debugging commands available in buffers
;; visiting IDL procedure files, e.g., breakpoint setting, stepping,
;; execution until a certain line, printing expressions under point,
;; visual line pointer for current execution line, etc.
;;
;; Documentation should be available online with `M-x idlwave-info'.

;; INSTALLATION:
;; =============
;; 
;; Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file of the distribution.
;; In short, put this file on your load path and add the following
;; lines to your .emacs file:
;;
;; (autoload 'idlwave-shell "idlw-shell" "IDLWAVE Shell" t)
;;
;;
;; SOURCE
;; ======
;;
;;   The newest version of this file can be found on the maintainers
;;   web site.
;; 
;;     http://www.strw.leidenuniv.el/~dominik/Tools/idlwave
;; 
;; DOCUMENTATION
;; =============
;;
;; IDLWAVE is documented online in info format.
;; A printable version of the documentation is available from the
;; maintainers webpage (see under SOURCE)
;;
;;
;; KNOWN PROBLEMS
;; ==============
;;
;; I don't plan on implementing directory tracking by watching the IDL
;; commands entered at the prompt, since too often an IDL procedure
;; will change the current directory. If you want the idl process
;; buffer to match the IDL current working just execute `M-x
;; idlwave-shell-resync-dirs' (bound to "\C-c\C-d\C-w" by default.)
;;
;; Under XEmacs the Debug menu in the shell does not display the
;; keybindings in the prefix map.  There bindings are available anyway - so
;; it is a bug in XEmacs.
;; The Debug menu in source buffers *does* display the bindings correctly.
;;
;; 
;; CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES
;; =======================
;;
;; IDLWAVE has customize support - so if you want to learn about
;; the variables which control the behavior of the mode, use
;; `M-x idlwave-customize'.

  "The three regular expressions which match the magic spells for input modes.

When the first regexp matches in the output streem of IDL, IDLWAVE
prompts for a single character and sends it immediately to IDL, similar
to the command \\[idlwave-shell-send-char].

When the second regexp matches, IDLWAVE switches to a blocking
single-character input mode.  This is the same mode which can be entered
manually with \\[idlwave-shell-char-mode-loop].
This input mode exits when the third regexp matches in the output,
or when the IDL prompt is encountered.

The variable `idlwave-shell-use-input-mode-magic' must be non-nil to enable
scanning for these expressions.  If the IDL program produces lots of
output, shell operation may be slowed down.

This mechanism is useful for correct interaction with the IDL function
GET_KBRD, because in normal operation IDLWAVE only sends \\n terminated
strings.  Here is some example code which makes use of the default spells.

  print,'<chars>'               ; Make IDLWAVE switch to character mode
  REPEAT BEGIN
      A = GET_KBRD(1)
      PRINT, BYTE(A)
  ENDREP UNTIL A EQ 'q'
  print,'</chars>'              ; Make IDLWAVE switch back to line mode

  print,'Quit the program, y or n?'
  print,'<onechar>'             ; Ask IDLWAVE to send one character
  answer = GET_KBRD(1)

Since the IDLWAVE shell defines the system variable `!IDLWAVE_VERSION',
you could actually check if you are running under Emacs before printing 
the magic strings.  Here is a procedure which uses this.

Usage:
======
idlwave_char_input               ; Make IDLWAVE send one character
idlwave_char_input,/on           ; Start the loop to send characters
idlwave_char_input,/off          ; End the loop to send chracters

  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior IDL process.

1. Shell Interaction
   -----------------
   RET after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
   end of process to the end of the current line.  RET before end of
   process output copies the current line (except for the prompt) to the
   end of the buffer.

   Command history, searching of previous commands, command line
   editing are available via the comint-mode key bindings, by default
   mostly on the key `C-c'.  Command history is also available with
   the arrow keys UP and DOWN.

2. Completion
   ----------
   TAB and M-TAB do completion of IDL routines, classes and keywords -
   similar to M-TAB in `idlwave-mode'.  In executive commands and
   strings, it completes file names.  Abbreviations are also expanded
   like in `idlwave-mode'.

3. Routine Info
   ------------
   `\\[idlwave-routine-info]' displays information about an IDL routine near point,
   just like in `idlwave-mode'.  The module used is the one at point or
   the one whose argument list is being edited.
   To update IDLWAVE's knowledge about compiled or edited modules, use 
   \\[idlwave-update-routine-info].
   \\[idlwave-find-module] find the source of a module.
   \\[idlwave-resolve] tells IDL to compile an unresolved module.
   \\[idlwave-context-help] shows the online help on the item at
   point, if online help has been installed.
  

4. Debugging
   ---------
   A complete set of commands for compiling and debugging IDL programs
   is available from the menu.  Also keybindings starting with a 
   `C-c C-d' prefix are available for most commands in the *idl* buffer
   and also in source buffers.  The best place to learn about the
   keybindings is again the menu.

   On Emacs versions where this is possible, a debugging toolbar is
   installed.

   When IDL is halted in the middle of a procedure, the corresponding
   line of that procedure file is displayed with an overlay in another
   window.  Breakpoints are also highlighted in the source.

   \\[idlwave-shell-resync-dirs] queries IDL in order to change Emacs current directory
   to correspond to the IDL process current directory.

5. Hooks
   -----
   Turning on `idlwave-shell-mode' runs `comint-mode-hook' and
   `idlwave-shell-mode-hook' (in that order).

6. Documentation and Customization
   -------------------------------
   Info documentation for this package is available.  Use \\[idlwave-info]
   to display (complain to your sysadmin if that does not work).
   For Postscript and HTML versions of the documentation, check IDLWAVE's
   homepage at `http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~dominik/Tools/idlwave'.
   IDLWAVE has customize support - see the group `idlwave'.

We need to work hard here to remove the stupid line breaks inserted by
IDL5.  These line breaks can be right in the middle of procedure

It is very difficult to come up with a robust solution.  This one seems
to be pretty good though.  

Here is in what ways it improves over the previous solution:

1. The procedure name can be split and will be restored.
2. The number can be split.  I have never seen this, but who knows.
3. We do not require the `.pro' extension for files.

This function can still break when the file name ends on a end line
and the message line contains an additional line with garbage.  Then
the first part of that garbage will be added to the file name.
However, the function checks the existence of the files with and
without this last part - thus the function only breaks if file name
plus garbage match an existing regular file.  This is hopefully very
unlikely."
