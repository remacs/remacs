;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Flymake is a minor Emacs mode performing on-the-fly syntax checks.
;;
;; It collects diagnostic information for multiple sources and
;; visually annotates the relevant lines in the buffer.
;;
;; This file is just a stub for that loads the UI and backends, which
;; could also be loaded separately.

;;; Code:

(require 'flymake-ui)
(require 'flymake-proc)

(provide 'flymake)
;;; flymake.el ends here
