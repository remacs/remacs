;;; Commentary:

;; NOTE: Read the commentary below for the right way to submit bug reports!
;; NOTE: See the accompanying texinfo manual for details on using this mode!
;; Note: The version string is in cc-defs.

;; This package provides GNU Emacs major modes for editing C, C++,
;; Objective-C, Java, CORBA's IDL, Pike and AWK code.  As of the
;; latest Emacs and XEmacs releases, it is the default package for
;; editing these languages.  This package is called "CC Mode", and
;; should be spelled exactly this way.

;; CC Mode supports K&R and ANSI C, ANSI C++, Objective-C, Java,
;; CORBA's IDL, Pike and AWK with a consistent indentation model
;; across all modes.  This indentation model is intuitive and very
;; flexible, so that almost any desired style of indentation can be
;; supported.  Installation, usage, and programming details are
;; contained in an accompanying texinfo manual.

;; CC Mode's immediate ancestors were, c++-mode.el, cplus-md.el, and
;; cplus-md1.el..

;; To submit bug reports, type "C-c C-b".  These will be sent to
;; bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (mirrored as the Usenet newsgroup
;; gnu.emacs.bug) as well as bug-cc-mode@gnu.org, which directly
;; contacts the CC Mode maintainers.  Questions can sent to
;; help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (mirrored as gnu.emacs.help) and/or
;; bug-cc-mode@gnu.org.  Please do not send bugs or questions to our
;; personal accounts; we reserve the right to ignore such email!

;; Many, many thanks go out to all the folks on the beta test list.
;; Without their patience, testing, insight, code contributions, and
;; encouragement CC Mode would be a far inferior package.

;; You can get the latest version of CC Mode, including PostScript
;; documentation and separate individual files from:
;;
;;     http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/
;;
;; You can join a moderated CC Mode announcement-only mailing list by
;; visiting
;;
;;    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/cc-mode-announce

;; Externally maintained major modes which use CC-mode's engine include:
;; - cuda-mode
;; - csharp-mode (https://github.com/josteink/csharp-mode)
;; - haxe-mode
;; - d-mode
;; - dart-mode
;; - cc-php-js-cs.el
;; - php-mode
;; - yang-mode
