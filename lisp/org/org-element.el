;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Org syntax can be divided into three categories: "Greater
;; elements", "Elements" and "Objects".
;;
;; Elements are related to the structure of the document.  Indeed, all
;; elements are a cover for the document: each position within belongs
;; to at least one element.
;;
;; An element always starts and ends at the beginning of a line.  With
;; a few exceptions (namely `babel-call', `clock', `headline', `item',
;; `keyword', `planning', `property-drawer' and `section' types), it
;; can also accept a fixed set of keywords as attributes.  Those are
;; called "affiliated keywords" to distinguish them from other
;; keywords, which are full-fledged elements.  Almost all affiliated
;; keywords are referenced in `org-element-affiliated-keywords'; the
;; others are export attributes and start with "ATTR_" prefix.
;;
;; Element containing other elements (and only elements) are called
;; greater elements.  Concerned types are: `center-block', `drawer',
;; `dynamic-block', `footnote-definition', `headline', `inlinetask',
;; `item', `plain-list', `quote-block', `section' and `special-block'.
;;
;; Other element types are: `babel-call', `clock', `comment',
;; `comment-block', `example-block', `export-block', `fixed-width',
;; `horizontal-rule', `keyword', `latex-environment', `paragraph',
;; `planning', `property-drawer', `quote-section', `src-block',
;; `table', `table-row' and `verse-block'.  Among them, `paragraph'
;; and `verse-block' types can contain Org objects and plain text.
;;
;; Objects are related to document's contents.  Some of them are
;; recursive.  Associated types are of the following: `bold', `code',
;; `entity', `export-snippet', `footnote-reference',
;; `inline-babel-call', `inline-src-block', `italic',
;; `latex-fragment', `line-break', `link', `macro', `radio-target',
;; `statistics-cookie', `strike-through', `subscript', `superscript',
;; `table-cell', `target', `timestamp', `underline' and `verbatim'.
;;
;; Some elements also have special properties whose value can hold
;; objects themselves (i.e. an item tag or an headline name).  Such
;; values are called "secondary strings".  Any object belongs to
;; either an element or a secondary string.
;;
;; Notwithstanding affiliated keywords, each greater element, element
;; and object has a fixed set of properties attached to it.  Among
;; them, four are shared by all types: `:begin' and `:end', which
;; refer to the beginning and ending buffer positions of the
;; considered element or object, `:post-blank', which holds the number
;; of blank lines, or white spaces, at its end and `:parent' which
;; refers to the element or object containing it.  Greater elements
;; and elements containing objects will also have `:contents-begin'
;; and `:contents-end' properties to delimit contents.
;;
;; Lisp-wise, an element or an object can be represented as a list.
;; It follows the pattern (TYPE PROPERTIES CONTENTS), where:
;;   TYPE is a symbol describing the Org element or object.
;;   PROPERTIES is the property list attached to it.  See docstring of
;;              appropriate parsing function to get an exhaustive
;;              list.
;;   CONTENTS is a list of elements, objects or raw strings contained
;;            in the current element or object, when applicable.
;;
;; An Org buffer is a nested list of such elements and objects, whose
;; type is `org-data' and properties is nil.
;;
;; The first part of this file defines Org syntax, while the second
;; one provide accessors and setters functions.
;;
;; The next part implements a parser and an interpreter for each
;; element and object type in Org syntax.
;;
;; The following part creates a fully recursive buffer parser.  It
;; also provides a tool to map a function to elements or objects
;; matching some criteria in the parse tree.  Functions of interest
;; are `org-element-parse-buffer', `org-element-map' and, to a lesser
;; extent, `org-element-parse-secondary-string'.
;;
;; The penultimate part is the cradle of an interpreter for the
;; obtained parse tree: `org-element-interpret-data'.
;;
;; The library ends by furnishing `org-element-at-point' function, and
;; a way to give information about document structure around point
;; with `org-element-context'.

;;; Definitions And Rules
;;
;; Define elements, greater elements and specify recursive objects,
;; along with the affiliated keywords recognized.  Also set up
;; restrictions on recursive objects combinations.
;;
;; These variables really act as a control center for the parsing
;; process.

;;; Greater elements
;;
;; For each greater element type, we define a parser and an
;; interpreter.
;;
;; A parser returns the element or object as the list described above.
;; Most of them accepts no argument.  Though, exceptions exist.  Hence
;; every element containing a secondary string (see
;; `org-element-secondary-value-alist') will accept an optional
;; argument to toggle parsing of that secondary string.  Moreover,
;; `item' parser requires current list's structure as its first
;; element.
;;
;; An interpreter accepts two arguments: the list representation of
;; the element or object, and its contents.  The latter may be nil,
;; depending on the element or object considered.  It returns the
;; appropriate Org syntax, as a string.
;;
;; Parsing functions must follow the naming convention:
;; org-element-TYPE-parser, where TYPE is greater element's type, as
;; defined in `org-element-greater-elements'.
;;
;; Similarly, interpreting functions must follow the naming
;; convention: org-element-TYPE-interpreter.
;;
;; With the exception of `headline' and `item' types, greater elements
;; cannot contain other greater elements of their own type.
;;
;; Beside implementing a parser and an interpreter, adding a new
;; greater element requires to tweak `org-element--current-element'.
;; Moreover, the newly defined type must be added to both
;; `org-element-all-elements' and `org-element-greater-elements'.

;;; Elements
;;
;; For each element, a parser and an interpreter are also defined.
;; Both follow the same naming convention used for greater elements.
;;
;; Also, as for greater elements, adding a new element type is done
;; through the following steps: implement a parser and an interpreter,
;; tweak `org-element--current-element' so that it recognizes the new
;; type and add that new type to `org-element-all-elements'.
;;
;; As a special case, when the newly defined type is a block type,
;; `org-element-block-name-alist' has to be modified accordingly.

;;; Objects
;;
;; Unlike to elements, interstices can be found between objects.
;; That's why, along with the parser, successor functions are provided
;; for each object.  Some objects share the same successor (i.e. `code'
;; and `verbatim' objects).
;;
;; A successor must accept a single argument bounding the search.  It
;; will return either a cons cell whose CAR is the object's type, as
;; a symbol, and CDR the position of its next occurrence, or nil.
;;
;; Successors follow the naming convention:
;; org-element-NAME-successor, where NAME is the name of the
;; successor, as defined in `org-element-all-successors'.
;;
;; Some object types (i.e. `italic') are recursive.  Restrictions on
;; object types they can contain will be specified in
;; `org-element-object-restrictions'.
;;
;; Adding a new type of object is simple.  Implement a successor,
;; a parser, and an interpreter for it, all following the naming
