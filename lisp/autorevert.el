;;; Commentary:

;; Introduction:
;;
;; Whenever a file that Emacs is editing has been changed by another
;; program the user normally has to execute the command `revert-buffer'
;; to load the new content of the file into Emacs.
;;
;; This package contains two minor modes: Global Auto-Revert Mode and
;; Auto-Revert Mode.  Both modes automatically revert buffers
;; whenever the corresponding files have been changed on disk and the
;; buffer contains no unsaved changes.
;;
;; Auto-Revert Mode can be activated for individual buffers.  Global
;; Auto-Revert Mode applies to all file buffers. (If the user option
;; `global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers' is non-nil, it also applies
;; to some non-file buffers.  This option is disabled by default.)
;;
;; Since checking a remote file is slow, these modes check or revert
;; remote files only if the user option `auto-revert-remote-files' is
;; non-nil.  It is recommended to disable version control for remote
;; files.
;;
;; Both modes operate by checking the time stamp of all files at
;; intervals of `auto-revert-interval'.  The default is every five
;; seconds.  The check is aborted whenever the user actually uses
;; Emacs.  You should never even notice that this package is active
;; (except that your buffers will be reverted, of course).
;;
;; If the file exists, Auto-Revert Mode updates the buffer based on
;; its (possibly empty) contents.  If the file no longer exists, then
;; there is nothing to revert, so it does not modify the buffer.  Once
;; a deleted file corresponding to a buffer in Auto-Revert Mode
;; reappears, Auto-Revert Mode continues to work.
;;
;; If Emacs is compiled with file notification support, notifications
;; are used instead of checking the time stamp of the files.  You can
;; disable this by setting the user option `auto-revert-use-notify' to
;; nil.  Alternatively, a regular expression of directories to be
;; excluded from file notifications can be specified by
;; `auto-revert-notify-exclude-dir-regexp'.
;;
;; After reverting a file buffer, Auto-Revert Mode normally puts point
;; at the same position that a regular manual revert would.  However,
;; there is one exception to this rule.  If point is at the end of the
;; buffer before reverting, it stays at the end.  Similarly if point
;; is displayed at the end of a file buffer in any window, it will stay
;; at the end of the buffer in that window, even if the window is not
;; selected.  This way, you can use Auto-Revert Mode to `tail' a file.
;; Just put point at the end of the buffer and it will stay there.
;; These rules apply to file buffers. For non-file buffers, the
;; behavior may be mode dependent.
;;
;; While you can use Auto-Revert Mode to tail a file, this package
;; contains a third minor mode, Auto-Revert Tail Mode, which does so
;; more efficiently, as long as you are sure that the file will only
;; change by growing at the end.  It only appends the new output,
;; instead of reverting the entire buffer.  It does so even if the
;; buffer contains unsaved changes.  (Because they will not be lost.)

;; Usage:
;;
;; Go to the appropriate buffer and press either of:
;;   M-x auto-revert-mode RET
;;   M-x auto-revert-tail-mode RET
;;
;; To activate Global Auto-Revert Mode, press:
;;   M-x global-auto-revert-mode RET
;;
;; To activate Global Auto-Revert Mode every time Emacs is started
;; customize the option `global-auto-revert-mode' or the following
;; line could be added to your ~/.emacs:
;;   (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
;;
;; The function `turn-on-auto-revert-mode' could be added to any major
;; mode hook to activate Auto-Revert Mode for all buffers in that
;; mode.  For example, the following line will activate Auto-Revert
;; Mode in all C mode buffers:
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook #'turn-on-auto-revert-mode)

;; The two modes will be placed next to Auto Save Mode under the
;; Files group under Emacs.
