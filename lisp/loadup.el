;;; Commentary:

;; This is loaded into a bare Emacs to make a dumpable one.

;; If you add/remove Lisp files to be loaded here, consider the
;; following issues:

;; i) Any file loaded on all platforms should appear in $lisp
;; and $shortlisp in src/Makefile.in.  Use the .el or .elc version as
;; appropriate.

;; ii) Any file that is only loaded on some platforms should appear
;; in the version of $lisp in the generated Makefile on that platform.
;; At the present time, this is achieved by use of #ifdefs.
;; It should also appear in $SOME_MACHINE_LISP on all platforms.

;; The above steps ensure both that the Lisp files are compiled (if
;; necessary) before the emacs executable is dumped, and that they are
;; passed to make-docfile.  (Any that are not processed for DOC will
;; not have doc strings in the dumped Emacs.)  Because of this:

;; iii) If the file is loaded uncompiled, it should (where possible)
;; obey the doc-string conventions expected by make-docfile.

;;; Code:

;; Add subdirectories to the load-path for files that might get
;; autoloaded when bootstrapping.
