;;; Commentary:

;; This is loaded into a bare Emacs to make a dumpable one.

;; If you add a file to be loaded here, keep the following points in mind:

;; i) If the file is no-byte-compile, explicitly load the .el version.
;; Such files should (where possible) obey the doc-string conventions
;; expected by make-docfile.  They should also be added to the
;; uncompiled[] list in make-docfile.c.

;; ii) If the file is dumped with Emacs (on any platform), put the
;; load statement at the start of a line (leading whitespace is ok).

;; iii) If the file is _not_ dumped with Emacs, make sure the load
;; statement is _not_ at the start of a line.  See pcase for an example.

;; These rules are so that src/Makefile can construct lisp.mk automatically.
;; This ensures both that the Lisp files are compiled (if necessary)
;; before the emacs executable is dumped, and that they are passed to
;; make-docfile.  (Any that are not processed for DOC will not have
;; doc strings in the dumped Emacs.)

;;; Code:

;; This is used in xdisp.c to determine when bidi reordering is safe.
;; (It starts non-nil in temacs, but we set it non-nil here anyway, in
;; case someone loads loadup one more time.)  We reset it after
;; successfully loading charprop.el, which defines the Unicode tables
;; bidi.c needs for its job.
