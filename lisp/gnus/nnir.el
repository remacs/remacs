;;; Commentary:

;; What does it do?  Well, it allows you to search your mail using
;; some search engine (imap, namazu, swish-e, gmane and others -- see
;; later) by typing `G G' in the Group buffer.  You will then get a
;; buffer which shows all articles matching the query, sorted by
;; Retrieval Status Value (score).

;; When looking at the retrieval result (in the Summary buffer) you
;; can type `A W' (aka M-x gnus-warp-to-article RET) on an article.  You
;; will be warped into the group this article came from. Typing `A T'
;; (aka M-x gnus-summary-refer-thread RET) will warp to the group and
;; also show the thread this article is part of.

;; The Lisp setup may involve setting a few variables and setting up the
;; search engine. You can define the variables in the server definition
;; like this :
;;   (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '(
;;       (nnimap "" (nnimap-address "localhost")
;;                  (nnir-search-engine namazu)
;;       )))
;; The main variable to set is `nnir-search-engine'.  Choose one of
;; the engines listed in `nnir-engines'.  (Actually `nnir-engines' is
;; an alist, type `C-h v nnir-engines RET' for more information; this
;; includes examples for setting `nnir-search-engine', too.)

;; If you use one of the local indices (namazu, find-grep, swish) you
;; must also set up a search engine backend.

;; 1. Namazu
;;
;; The Namazu backend requires you to have one directory containing all
;; index files, this is controlled by the `nnir-namazu-index-directory'
;; variable.  To function the `nnir-namazu-remove-prefix' variable must
;; also be correct, see the documentation for `nnir-namazu-remove-prefix'
;; above.
;;
;; It is particularly important not to pass any switches to namazu
;; that will change the output format.  Good switches to use include
;; `--sort', `--ascending', `--early' and `--late'.  Refer to the Namazu
;; documentation for further information on valid switches.
;;
;; To index my mail with the `mknmz' program I use the following
;; configuration file:
;;
;; ,----
;; | package conf;  # Don't remove this line!
;; |
;; | # Paths which will not be indexed. Don't use `^' or `$' anchors.
;; | $EXCLUDE_PATH = "spam|sent";
;; |
;; | # Header fields which should be searchable. case-insensitive
;; | $REMAIN_HEADER = "from|date|message-id|subject";
;; |
;; | # Searchable fields. case-insensitive
;; | $SEARCH_FIELD = "from|date|message-id|subject";
;; |
;; | # The max length of a word.
;; | $WORD_LENG_MAX = 128;
;; |
;; | # The max length of a field.
;; | $MAX_FIELD_LENGTH = 256;
;; `----
;;
;; My mail is stored in the directories ~/Mail/mail/, ~/Mail/lists/ and
;; ~/Mail/archive/, so to index them I go to the directory set in
;; `nnir-namazu-index-directory' and issue the following command.
;;
;;      mknmz --mailnews ~/Mail/archive/ ~/Mail/mail/ ~/Mail/lists/
;;
;; For maximum searching efficiency I have a cron job set to run this
;; command every four hours.

;; 2. find-grep
;;
;; The find-grep engine simply runs find(1) to locate eligible
;; articles and searches them with grep(1).  This, of course, is much
;; slower than using a proper search engine but OTOH doesn't require
;; maintenance of an index and is still faster than using any built-in
;; means for searching.  The method specification of the server to
;; search must include a directory for this engine to work (E.g.,
;; `nnml-directory').  The tools must be POSIX compliant.  GNU Find
;; prior to version 4.2.12 (4.2.26 on Linux due to incorrect ARG_MAX
;; handling) does not work.
;; ,----
;; |    ;; find-grep configuration for searching the Gnus Cache
;; |
;; |	(nnml "cache"
;; |          (nnml-get-new-mail nil)
;; |          (nnir-search-engine find-grep)
;; |          (nnml-directory "~/News/cache/")
;; |          (nnml-active-file "~/News/cache/active"))

;; Developer information:

;; I have tried to make the code expandable.  Basically, it is divided
;; into two layers.  The upper layer is somewhat like the `nnvirtual'
;; backend: given a specification of what articles to show from
;; another backend, it creates a group containing exactly those
;; articles.  The lower layer issues a query to a search engine and
;; produces such a specification of what articles to show from the
;; other backend.

;; The interface between the two layers consists of the single
;; function `nnir-run-query', which dispatches the search to the
;; proper search function.  The argument of `nnir-run-query' is an
;; alist with two keys: 'nnir-query-spec and 'nnir-group-spec. The
;; value for 'nnir-query-spec is an alist. The only required key/value
;; pair is (query . "query") specifying the search string to pass to
;; the query engine. Individual engines may have other elements. The
;; value of 'nnir-group-spec is a list with the specification of the
;; groups/servers to search.  The format of the 'nnir-group-spec is
;; (("server1" ("group11" "group12")) ("server2" ("group21"
;; "group22"))). If any of the group lists is absent then all groups
;; on that server are searched.

;; The output of `nnir-run-query' is supposed to be a vector, each
;; element of which should in turn be a three-element vector.  The
;; first element should be full group name of the article, the second
;; element should be the article number, and the third element should
;; be the Retrieval Status Value (RSV) as returned from the search
;; engine.  An RSV is the score assigned to the document by the search
;; engine.  For Boolean search engines, the RSV is always 1000 (or 1
;; or 100, or whatever you like).

;; The sorting order of the articles in the summary buffer created by
;; nnir is based on the order of the articles in the above mentioned
;; vector, so that's where you can do the sorting you'd like.  Maybe
;; it would be nice to have a way of displaying the search result
;; sorted differently?

;; So what do you need to do when you want to add another search
;; engine?  You write a function that executes the query.  Temporary
;; data from the search engine can be put in `nnir-tmp-buffer'.  This
;; function should return the list of articles as a vector, as
;; described above.  Then, you need to register this backend in
;; `nnir-engines'.  Then, users can choose the backend by setting
;; `nnir-search-engine' as a server variable.

This implements a little language designed to return the expected results

The search is always case-insensitive, as defined by RFC2060, and supports
the following features (inspired by the Google search input language):

Automatic \"and\" queries
    If you specify multiple words then they will be treated as an \"and\"
    expression intended to match all components.

Phrase searches
    If you wrap your query in double-quotes then it will be treated as a
    literal string.

Negative terms
    If you precede a term with \"-\" then it will negate that.

\"OR\" queries
    If you include an upper-case \"OR\" in your search it will cause the
    term before it and the term after it to be treated as alternatives.

In future the following will be added to the language:
 * support for date matches
 * support for location of text matching within the query
 * from/to/etc headers
 * additional search terms
 * flag based searching
 * anything else that the RFC supports, basically."
