;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides function for working with obarrays.

;;; Code:

(defconst obarray-default-size 59
  "The value 59 is an arbitrary prime number that gives a good hash.")

(defun obarray-make (&optional size)
  "Return a new obarray of size SIZE or `obarray-default-size'."
  (let ((size (or size obarray-default-size)))
    (if (< 0 size)
        (make-vector size 0)
      (signal 'wrong-type-argument '(size 0)))))

(defun obarray-size (ob)
  "Return the number of slots of obarray OB."
  (length ob))

(defun obarrayp (object)
  "Return t if OBJECT is an obarray."
  (and (vectorp object)
       (< 0 (length object))))

;; Don’t use obarray as a variable name to avoid shadowing.
(defun obarray-get (ob name)
  "Return symbol named NAME if it is contained in obarray OB.
Return nil otherwise."
  (intern-soft name ob))

(defun obarray-put (ob name)
  "Return symbol named NAME from obarray OB.
Creates and adds the symbol if doesn't exist."
  (intern name ob))

(defun obarray-remove (ob name)
  "Remove symbol named NAME if it is contained in obarray OB.
Return t on success, nil otherwise."
  (unintern name ob))

(defun obarray-map (fn ob)
  "Call function FN on every symbol in obarray OB and return nil."
  (mapatoms fn ob))

(provide 'obarray)
