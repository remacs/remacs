;;; Commentary:

;; Save the Desktop, i.e.,
;;	- some global variables
;; 	- the list of buffers with associated files.  For each buffer also
;;		- the major mode
;;		- the default directory
;;		- the point
;;		- the mark & mark-active
;;		- buffer-read-only
;;		- some local variables
;;	- frame and window configuration

;; To use this, use customize to turn on desktop-save-mode or add the
;; following line somewhere in your init file:
;;
;;	(desktop-save-mode 1)
;;
;; For further usage information, look at the section
;; (info "(emacs)Saving Emacs Sessions") in the GNU Emacs Manual.

;; When the desktop module is loaded, the function `desktop-kill' is
;; added to the `kill-emacs-hook'.  This function is responsible for
;; saving the desktop when Emacs is killed.  Furthermore an anonymous
;; function is added to the `after-init-hook'.  This function is
;; responsible for loading the desktop when Emacs is started.

;; Special handling.
;; -----------------
;; Variables `desktop-buffer-mode-handlers' and `desktop-minor-mode-handlers'
;; are supplied to handle special major and minor modes respectively.
;; `desktop-buffer-mode-handlers' is an alist of major mode specific functions
;; to restore a desktop buffer.  Elements must have the form
;;
;;    (MAJOR-MODE . RESTORE-BUFFER-FUNCTION).
;;
;; Functions listed are called by `desktop-create-buffer' when `desktop-read'
;; evaluates the desktop file.  Buffers with a major mode not specified here,
;; are restored by the default handler `desktop-restore-file-buffer'.
;; `desktop-minor-mode-handlers' is an alist of functions to restore
;; non-standard minor modes.  Elements must have the form
;;
;;    (MINOR-MODE . RESTORE-FUNCTION).
;;
;; Functions are called by `desktop-create-buffer' to restore minor modes.
;; Minor modes not specified here, are restored by the standard minor mode
;; function.  If you write a module that defines a major or minor mode that
;; needs a special handler, then place code like

;;    (defun foo-restore-desktop-buffer
;;    ...
;;    (add-to-list 'desktop-buffer-mode-handlers
;;                 '(foo-mode . foo-restore-desktop-buffer))

;; or

;;    (defun bar-desktop-restore
;;    ...
;;    (add-to-list 'desktop-minor-mode-handlers
;;                 '(bar-mode . bar-desktop-restore))

;; in the module itself.  The mode function must either be autoloaded,
;; or of the form "foobar-mode" and defined in library "foobar", so that
;; desktop can guess how to load its definition.
;; See the docstrings of `desktop-buffer-mode-handlers' and
;; `desktop-minor-mode-handlers' for more info.

;; Minor modes.
;; ------------
;; Conventional minor modes (see node "Minor Mode Conventions" in the elisp
;; manual) are handled in the following way:
;; When `desktop-save' saves the state of a buffer to the desktop file, it
;; saves as `desktop-minor-modes' the list of names of those variables in
;; `minor-mode-alist' that have a non-nil value.
;; When `desktop-create' restores the buffer, each of the symbols in
;; `desktop-minor-modes' is called as function with parameter 1.
;; The variables `desktop-minor-mode-table' and `desktop-minor-mode-handlers'
;; are used to handle non-conventional minor modes.  `desktop-save' uses
;; `desktop-minor-mode-table' to map minor mode variables to minor mode
;; functions before writing `desktop-minor-modes'.  If a minor mode has a
;; variable name that is different form its function name, an entry

;;    (NAME RESTORE-FUNCTION)

;; should be added to `desktop-minor-mode-table'.  If a minor mode should not
;; be restored, RESTORE-FUNCTION should be set to nil.  `desktop-create' uses
;; `desktop-minor-mode-handlers' to lookup minor modes that needs a restore
;; function different from the usual minor mode function.
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

;; By the way: don't use desktop.el to customize Emacs -- the file .emacs
;; in your home directory is used for that.  Saving global default values
;; for buffers is an example of misuse.

;; PLEASE NOTE: The kill ring can be saved as specified by the variable
;; `desktop-globals-to-save' (by default it isn't).  This may result in saving
;; things you did not mean to keep.  Use M-x desktop-clear RET.

Once a desktop file exists, Emacs will auto-save it according to the

You are recommended to do this once you have firmly upgraded to
Emacs 25.1 (or later).  To downgrade a version 208 file to version
206, use a double command prefix: C-u C-u M-x desktop-save.
Confirmation will be requested in either case.  In a non-interactive
