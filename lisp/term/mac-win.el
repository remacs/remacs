;;; Commentary:

;; Mac-win.el:  this file is loaded from ../lisp/startup.el when it recognizes
;; that Mac windows are to be used.  Command line switches are parsed and those
;; pertaining to Mac are processed and removed from the command line.  The
;; Mac display is opened and hooks are set for popping up the initial window.

;; startup.el will then examine startup files, and eventually call the hooks
;; which create the first window(s).

;;; Code:

;; These are the standard X switches from the Xt Initialize.c file of
;; Release 4.

;; Command line		Resource Manager string

;; +rv			*reverseVideo
;; +synchronous		*synchronous
;; -background		*background
;; -bd			*borderColor
