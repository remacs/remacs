	root only.

	Simplify use of current-time and friends.

2014-06-19  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* semantic/ia.el (semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu): Use posn-at-point

2013-12-28  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* ede/linux.el (project-linux-build-directory-default)
	(project-linux-architecture-default): Fix custom types.  Add version.

2013-12-12  David Engster  <deng@randomsample.de>

	* semantic/analyze.el (semantic-analyze-find-tag-sequence-default):
	Always add scope to the local miniscope for each type.  Otherwise,
	structure tags are not analyzed correctly.  Also, always search
	the extended miniscope even when not dealing with types.

	* semantic/ctxt.el (semantic-get-local-variables-default):
	Also try to parse local variables for buffers which are currently
	marked as unparsable.  Otherwise, it is often impossible to
	complete local variables.

	* semantic/scope.el (semantic-analyze-scoped-types-default): If we
	cannot find a type in the typecache, also look into the types
	we already found.  This is necessary since in C++, a 'using
	namespace' can be dependend on a previous one.
	(semantic-completable-tags-from-type): When creating the list of
	completable types, pull in types which are referenced through
	'using' statements, and also preserve their filenames.

	* semantic/bovine/c.el (semantic/analyze/refs): Require.
	(semantic-analyze-tag-references): New override.  Mainly copied
	from the default implementation, but if nothing could be found (or
	just the tag itself), drop all namespaces from the scope and
	search again.  This is necessary for implementations which are
	defined outside of the namespace and only pull those in through
	'using' statements.
	(semantic-ctxt-scoped-types): Go through all tags around point and
	search them for using statements.  In the case for using
	statements outside of function scope, append them in the correct
	order instead of using 'cons'.  This is important since using
	statements may depend on previous ones.
	(semantic-expand-c-tag-namelist): Do not try to parse struct
	definitions as default values.  The grammar parser seems to return
	the point positions slightly differently (as a cons instead of a
	list).  Also, set parent for typedefs to 'nil'.  It does not
	really make sense to set a parent class for typedefs, and it can
	also lead to endless loops when calculating scope.
	(semantic-c-reconstitute-token): Change handling of function
	pointers; instead of seeing them as variables, handle them as
	functions with a 'function-pointer' attribute.  Also, correctly
	deal with function pointers as function arguments.
	(semantic-c-reconstitute-function-arglist): New function to parse
	function pointers inside an argument list.
	(semantic-format-tag-name): Use 'function-pointer' attribute
	instead of the old 'functionpointer-flag'.
	(semantic-cpp-lexer): Use new `semantic-lex-spp-paren-or-list'.

	* semantic/bovine/gcc.el (semantic-gcc-setup): Add 'features.h' to
	the list of files whose preprocessor symbols are included.
	This pulls in things like __USE_POSIX and similar.

	* semantic/format.el (semantic-format-tag-prototype-default):
	Display default values if available.

	* semantic/analyze/refs.el (semantic-analyze-refs-impl)
	(semantic-analyze-refs-proto): Add 'default-value' as ignorable in
	call to `semantic-tag-similar-p'.

	* semantic/db-mode.el (semanticdb-semantic-init-hook-fcn):
	Always set buffer for `semanticdb-current-table'.

	* semantic/db.el (semanticdb-table::semanticdb-refresh-table):
	The previous change turned up a bug in this method.  Since the current
	table now correctly has a buffer set, the first clause in the
	`cond' would be taken, but there was a `save-excursion' missing.

	* semantic/lex-spp.el (semantic-c-end-of-macro): Declare.
	(semantic-lex-spp-token-macro-to-macro-stream): Deal with macros
	which open/close a scope.  For this, leave an overlay if we
	encounter a single open paren and return a semantic-list in the
	lexer.  When this list gets expanded, retrieve the old position
	from the overlay.  See the comments in the function for further
	details.
	(semantic-lex-spp-find-closing-macro): New function to find the
	next macro which closes scope (i.e., has a closing paren).
	(semantic-lex-spp-replace-or-symbol-or-keyword): Go to end of
	closing macro if necessary.
	(semantic-lex-spp-paren-or-list): New lexer to specially deal with
	parens in macro definitions.

	* semantic/decorate/mode.el (semantic-decoration-mode): Do not
