#
# make clean  or  make mostlyclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
#
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
#
# make realclean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files
#      produced by Bison, tags tables, info files, and so on.
#
# make extraclean
#      Still more severe - delete backup and autosave files, too.
