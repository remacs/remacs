This directory contains the source of the "Introduction to Programming
in Emacs Lisp" written by Robert J. Chassell, bob@gnu.org.  This
manual is an elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp for
people who are not programmers, and who are not necessarily interested
in programming, but who do want to customize or extend their computing
environment.

This third edition of 2006 Oct 31 updates the previous editions to GNU
Emacs 22.

You will find additional instructions on formatting in the beginning
of the Texinfo file 'emacs-lisp-intro.texi'.  Best Wishes!
