@node Overview
@chapter Overview
@dfn{EWW}, the Emacs Web Wowser, is a web browser for GNU Emacs.  It
can load, parse, and display various web pages using @dfn{shr.el}.
However a GNU Emacs with @code{libxml2} support is required.

@node Basics
@chapter Basic Usage

@findex eww
@findex eww-open-file
@vindex eww-search-prefix
@cindex eww
@cindex Web Browsing
  You can open a URL or search the web with the command @kbd{M-x eww}.
If the input doesn't look like a URL or domain name the web will be
searched via @code{eww-search-prefix}.  The default search engine is
@url{https://duckduckgo.com, DuckDuckGo}.  If you want to open a file
either prefix the file name with @code{file://} or use the command
@kbd{M-x eww-open-file}.

@findex eww-quit
@findex eww-reload
@findex eww-copy-page-url
@kindex q
@kindex w
@kindex g
  If loading the URL was successful the buffer @file{*eww*} is opened
and the web page is rendered in it.  You can leave EWW by pressing
@kbd{q} or exit the browser by calling @kbd{eww-quit}.  To reload the
web page hit @kbd{g} (@code{eww-reload}).  Pressing @kbd{w}
(@code{eww-copy-page-url}) will copy the current URL to the kill ring.

@findex eww-download
@vindex eww-download-directory
@kindex d
@cindex Download
  A URL under the point can be downloaded with @kbd{d}
(@code{eww-download}).  The file will be written to the directory
specified in @code{eww-download-directory} (Default: @file{~/Downloads/}).

@findex eww-back-url
@findex eww-forward-url
@findex eww-list-histories
@kindex r
@kindex l
@kindex H
@cindex History
  EWW remembers the URLs you have visited to allow you to go back and
forth between them.  By pressing @kbd{l} (@code{eww-back-url}) you go
to the previous URL.  You can go forward again with @kbd{r}
(@code{eww-forward-url}).  If you want an overview of your browsing
history press @kbd{H} (@code{eww-list-histories}) to open the history
buffer @file{*eww history*}.  The history is lost when EWW is quit.
If you want to remember websites you can use bookmarks.

@findex eww-add-bookmark
@findex eww-list-bookmarks
@kindex b
@kindex B
@cindex Bookmarks
  EWW allows you to @dfn{bookmark} URLs.  Simply hit @kbd{b}
(@code{eww-add-bookmark}) to store a bookmark for the current website.
You can view stored bookmarks with @kbd{B}
(@code{eww-list-bookmarks}).  This will open the bookmark buffer
@file{*eww bookmarks*}.

@findex eww-browse-with-external-browser
@vindex shr-external-browser
@vindex eww-use-external-browser-for-content-type
@kindex &
@cindex External Browser
  Although EWW and shr.el do their best to render webpages in GNU
Emacs some websites use features which can not be properly represented
or are not implemented (E.g., JavaScript).  If you have trouble
viewing a website with EWW then hit @kbd{&}
(@code{eww-browse-with-external-browser}) inside the EWW buffer to
open the website in the external browser specified by
@code{shr-external-browser}.  Some content types, such as video or
audio content, do not make sense to display in GNU Emacs at all.  You
can tell EWW to open specific content automatically in an external
browser by customizing
@code{eww-use-external-browser-for-content-type}.

@node Advanced
@chapter Advanced

@findex eww-view-source
@kindex v
@cindex Viewing Source
  You can view the source of a website with @kbd{v}
(@code{eww-view-source}).  This will open a new buffer
@file{*eww-source*} and insert the source.  The buffer will be set to
@code{html-mode} if available.

@findex url-cookie-list
@kindex C
@cindex Cookies
  EWW handles cookies through the @ref{Top, url package, ,url}.
You can list existing cookies with @kbd{C} (@code{url-cookie-list}).
For details about the Cookie handling @xref{Cookies,,,url}.

@vindex eww-header-line-format
@cindex Header
  The header line of the EWW buffer can be changed by customizing
@code{eww-header-line-format}.  The format replaces @code{%t} with the
title of the website and @code{%u} with the URL.

@c @vindex shr-bullet
@c @vindex shr-hr-line
@c @vindex eww-form-checkbox-selected-symbol
@c @vindex eww-form-checkbox-symbol
@c   EWW and the rendering engine shr.el use ASCII characters to
@c represent some graphical elements, such as bullet points
@c (@code{shr-bullet}), check boxes
@c (@code{eww-form-checkbox-selected-symbol} and
@c @code{eww-form-checkbox-symbol}), and horizontal rules
@c @code{shr-hr-line}).  Depending on your fonts these characters can be
@c replaced by Unicode glyphs to achieve better looking results.

@vindex shr-max-image-proportion
@vindex shr-blocked-images
@cindex Image Display
  Loading random images from the web can be problematic due to their
size or content.  By customizing @code{shr-max-image-proportion} you
can set the maximal image proportion in relation to the window they
are displayed in.  E.g., 0.7 means an image is allowed to take up 70%
of the width and height.  If Emacs supports image scaling (ImageMagick
support required) then larger images are scaled down.  You can block
specific images completely by customizing @code{shr-blocked-images}.

@node History and Acknowledgments
@appendix History and Acknowledgments

EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen, known for his work on
Gnus.  He started writing an Emacs HTML rendering library,
@code{shr.el}, to read blogs in Gnus.  He eventually added a web
browser front end and HTML form support.  Which resulted in EWW, the
Emacs Web Wowser.  EWW was announced on 16 June 2013:
@url{http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2013/06/16/eww/}.

EWW was then moved from the Gnus repository to GNU Emacs and several
developers started contributing to it as well.
