@ede{} is the Emacs Development Environment: an Emacs extension that
simplifies building and debugging programs in Emacs.  It attempts to
emulate a typical IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  @ede{}
can manage or create your makefiles and other building environment
duties, allowing you to concentrate on writing code rather than
support files.  It aims to make it much easier for new programmers to
learn and adopt GNU ways of doing things.

@chapter @ede{} Project Concepts

@ede{} is a generic interface for managing projects.  It specifies a
single set of menus and keybindings, while supporting multiple ways to
express a project via a build system.

In the subsequent chapters, we will describe the different project
types (@pxref{Creating a project}), as well as the commands to build
and debug projects (@pxref{Building and Debugging}).

In @ede{}, a project hierarchy matches a directory hierarchy.  The
project's topmost directory is called the @dfn{project root}, and its
subdirectories are @dfn{subprojects}.

Each project can contain multiple @dfn{targets}.  A target, at the
simplest level, is a named collection of files within a project.  A
target can specify two different types of information:

@enumerate
@item
A collection of files to be added to a distribution (e.g., a tarball
that you intend to distribute to others).

@item
A collection of files that can be built into something else (e.g., a
program or compiled documentation).
@end enumerate

Lastly, @ede{} provides a way for other tools to easily learn file
associations.  For example, a program might need to restrict some sort
of search to files in a single target, or to discover the location of
documentation or interface files.  @ede{} can provide this
information.

@node EDE Mode, Quick Start, EDE Project Concepts, Top
@chapter @ede{} Mode

@ede{} is implemented as a minor mode, which augments other modes such
as C mode, and Texinfo mode.  You can enable @ede{} for all buffers by
running the command @code{global-ede-mode}, or by putting this in your
init file:

@example
(global-ede-mode t)
@end example

Activating @ede{} adds a menu named @samp{Development} to the menu
bar.  This menu provides several menu items for high-level @ede{}
commands.  These menu items, and their corresponding keybindings, are
independent of the type of project you are actually working on.

@node Quick Start, Creating a project, EDE Mode, Top
@chapter Quick Start

Once you have @ede{} enabled, you can create a project.  This chapter
provides an example C++ project that will create Automake files for
compilation.

@section Step 1: Create root directory

First, lets create a directory for our project.  For this example,
we'll start with something in @file{/tmp}.

@example
C-x C-f /tmp/myproject/README RET
M-x make-directory RET RET
@end example

Now put some plain text in your README file to start.

Now, lets create the project:

@example
M-x ede-new RET Automake RET myproject RET
@end example


Nothing visible happened, but if you use @code{dired} to look at the
directory, you should see this:

@example
  /tmp/myproject:
  total used in directory 32 available 166643476
  drwxr-xr-x  2 zappo users  4096 2012-02-23 22:10 .
  drwxrwxrwt 73 root  root  20480 2012-02-23 22:10 ..
  -rw-r--r--  1 zappo users   195 2012-02-23 22:10 Project.ede
  -rw-r--r--  1 zappo users    10 2012-02-23 22:09 README
@end example

@section Step 2: Create Subdirectories and Files

We'll make a more complex project, so use dired to create some more
directories using the @kbd{+} key, and typing in new directories:

@example
+ include RET
+ src RET
@end example

Now I'll short-cut in this tutorial.  Create the following files:

@file{include/myproj.hh}
@example
/** myproj.hh ---
 */

#ifndef myproj_hh
#define myproj_hh 1

#define IMPORTANT_MACRO 1

int my_lib_function();

#endif // myproj_hh
@end example


@file{src/main.cpp}
@example
/** main.cpp ---
 */

#include <iostream>
#include "myproj.hh"

int main() @{

@}

#ifdef IMPORTANT_MACRO
int my_fcn() @{

@}
#endif
@end example

@file{src/mylib.cpp}
@example
/** mylib.cpp ---
 *
 * Shared Library to build
 */

int my_lib_function() @{

@}
@end example

@section Step 3: Create subprojects

@ede{} needs subdirectories to also have projects in them.  You can
now create those projects.

With @file{main.cpp} as your current buffer, type:

@example
M-x ede-new RET Automake RET src RET
@end example

and in @file{myproj.hh} as your current buffer, type:

@example
M-x ede-new RET Automake RET include RET
@end example

These steps effectively only create the Project.ede file in which you
will start adding targets.

@section Step 4: Create targets

In order to build a program, you must have targets in your @ede{}
Projects.  You can create targets either from a buffer, or from a
@code{dired} directory buffer.

Note: If for some reason a directory list buffer, or file does not have the
@samp{Project} menu item, or if @ede{} keybindings don't work, just
use @kbd{M-x revert-buffer RET} to force a refresh.  Sometimes
creating a new project doesn't restart buffers correctly.

Lets start with the header file.  In @file{include/myproj.hh}, you
could use the menu, but we will now start using the @ede{} command prefix
which is @kbd{C-c .}.

@example
C-c . t includes RET miscellaneous RET y
@end example


This creates a misc target for holding your includes, and then adds
myproj.hh to the target.  Automake (the tool) has better ways to do
this, but for this project, it is sufficient.

Next, visit the @file{src} directory using dired.  There should be a
@samp{Project} menu.   You can create a new target with

@example
. t myprogram RET program RET
@end example

Note that @kbd{. t} is a command for creating a target.  This command
is also in the menu.  This will create a target that will build a
program.  If you want, visit @file{Project.ede} to see the structure
built so far.

Next, place the cursor on @file{main.cpp}, and use @kbd{. a} to add
that file to your target.

@example
. a myprogram RET
@end example

Note that these prompts often have completion, so you can just press
@kbd{TAB} to complete the name @file{myprogram}.

If you had many files to add to the same target, you could mark them
all in your dired buffer, and add them all at the same time.

Next, do the same for the library by placing the cursor on @file{mylib.cpp}.

@example
. t mylib RET sharedobject RET
. a mylib RET
@end example

@section Step 5: Compile, and fail

Next, we'll try to compile the project, but we aren't done yet, so it
won't work right away.

Visit @file{/tmp/myproject/Project.ede}.  We're starting here because
we don't have any program files in this directory yet.  Now we can use
the compile command:

@example
C-c . C
@end example

Because this is the very first time, it will create a bunch of files
for you that are required by Automake.  It will then use automake to
build the support infrastructure it needs.  This step is skipped if
you choose just a @file{Makefile} build system.

After the Automake init, it runs compile.  You will immediately
discover the error in main.cpp can't find @file{myproj.hh}.  We need
to go fix this.

@section Step 6: Customizing your project

To fix the failed compile, we need to add
@file{/tmp/myproject/include} to the include path.

Visit @file{main.cpp}.

@example
M-x customize-project RET
@end example

Select the @samp{[Settings]} subgroup of options.  Under
@samp{Variable :} click @samp{[INS]}.  At this point, you need to be
somewhat savvy with Automake.  Add a variable named @samp{CPPFLAGS},
and set the value to @samp{../include}.

You should see something like this:

@example
Variables :
[INS] [DEL] Cons-cell:
            Name: AM_CPPFLAGS
            Value: -I../include
[INS]
Variables to set in this Makefile.
@end example

Click @samp{[Apply]}.  Feel free to visit @file{Project.ede} to see
how it changed the config file.

Compile the whole project again with @kbd{C-c . C} from
@file{main.cpp}.  It should now compile.

@section Step 7: Shared library dependency

Note: Supporting shared libraries for Automake in this way is easy,
but doing so from a project of type Makefile is a bit tricky.  If you
are creating shared libraries too, stick to Automake projects.

Next, lets add a dependency from @file{main.cpp} on our shared
library.  To do that, update main like this:

@example
int main() @{

  my_lib_function();

@}
@end example

Now compile with:

@example
C-c . c
@end example

where the lower case @kbd{c} compiles just that target.  You should
see an error.

This time, we need to add a dependency from @file{main.cpp} on our shared
library.  To do that, we need to customize our target instead of the
project.  This is because variables such as the include path are
treated globally, whereas dependencies for a target are target specific.

@example
M-x customize-target RET
@end example

On the first page, you will see an Ldlibs-local section.  Add mylib to
it by first clicking @samp{[INS]}, and they adding the library.  It
should look like this:

@example
Ldlibs-Local :
[INS] [DEL] Local Library: libmylib.la
[INS]
Libraries that are part of this project. [Hide Rest]
The full path to these libraries should be specified, such as:
../lib/libMylib.la  or ../ar/myArchive.a
@end example

You will also see other variables for library related flags and system
libraries if you need them.  Click @samp{[Accept]}, and from
@file{main.cpp}, again compile the whole project to force all
dependent elements to compile:

@example
C-c . C
@end example

@section Step 8: Run your program

You can run your program directly from @ede{}.

@example
C-c . R RET RET
@end example

If your program takes command line arguments, you can type them in
when it offers the command line you want to use to run your program.

@node Creating a project, Modifying your project, Quick Start, Top
@chapter Creating a project

To create a new project, first visit a file that you want to include
in that project.  If you have a hierarchy of directories, first visit
a file in the topmost directory.  From this buffer, type @kbd{M-x
ede-new}, or click on the @samp{Create Project} item in the
@samp{Development} menu.

The @command{ede-new} command prompts for the type of project you
would like to create.  Each project type has its own benefits or
language specific enhancements.  Not all projects that @ede{} supports
also allow creating a new project.  Projects such as @code{emacs}
or @code{linux} are designed to recognize existing projects only.
Project types such as @samp{Make} and @samp{Automake} do support
creating new project types with @command{ede-new}.

@itemize
@item
For the @samp{Make} project type, @ede{} creates a @dfn{project file},
called @file{Project.ede}, in each project directory.  Information
about the project is stored in this file.  This project autogenerates
a @file{Makefile}.

@item
For the @samp{Automake} project type, @ede{} creates a
@file{Project.ede} project file similar to a @samp{Make} project.
Unlike a @samp{Make} project, this project autogenerates a
@file{Makefile.am} file.  @ede{} handles the Automake bootstrapping
routines, which import and maintain a @file{configure.am} script and
other required files.
@end itemize

A subproject is merely a project in a subdirectory of another project.
You can create a subproject by using the @command{ede-new} command (or
the @samp{Create Project} menu item), while visiting a buffer in a
subdirectory of the project root.  This new project is automatically
added to the parent project, and will be automatically loaded when
@ede{} reads the parent project.

When using a project command that involves a makefile, @ede{} uses
the top-most project's makefile as a starting place for the build.  How
the toplevel project handles subprojects in the build process is
dependent on that project's type.

@chapter Modifying your project

In this chapter, we describe the generic features for manipulating
projects, including the targets and files within them.  Subsequent
chapters, which describe specific project types, will provide more
detailed information about exactly what these features do.

@section Add/Remove target

To create a new target, type @kbd{C-c . t} (@code{ede-new-target}) or
use the @samp{Add Target} menu item in the @samp{Project Options}
submenu.  This prompts for a target name, and adds the current buffer
to that target.

The @command{ede-new-target} command also prompts for a @dfn{target
type}.  Each target type has its own build process and class of files
that it will accept.

To remove a target from the project, type @kbd{M-x ede-delete-target},
or use the @samp{Remove Target} menu item in the @samp{Project
Options} submenu.

@node Add/Remove files, Customize Features, Add/Remove target, Modifying your project
@section Add/Remove files

To add the current file to an existing target, type @kbd{C-c . a}
(@code{ede-add-file}), or use the @samp{Add File} menu item in the
@samp{Target Options} submenu.

You can add a file to more than one target; this is OK.

To remove the current file from a target, type @kbd{C-c . d}
(@code{ede-remove-file}), or use the @samp{Remove File} menu item
in the @samp{Target Options} submenu.  If the file belongs to multiple
targets, this command prompts for each target it could be removed
from.

While working in a project, if you visit a file that is not part of an
existing target, @ede{} automatically prompts for a target.  If you do
not wish to add the file to any target, you can choose @samp{none}.
You can customize this behavior with the variable
@command{ede-auto-add-method}.

@node Customize Features, Project Local Variables, Add/Remove files, Modifying your project
@section Customize Features

A project, and its targets, are objects using the @samp{EIEIO} object
system.  @xref{Top,,,eieio,EIEIO manual}.  These objects have data
fields containing important information related to your work.

If the high-level functions aren't enough, you can tweak all
user-customizable fields at any time by running the command
@command{customize-project} or @command{customize-target}.  This loads
the current project or target into a customization buffer, where you
can tweak individual slots.  This is usually necessary for complex
projects.

Some project modes do not have a project file, but directly read a
Makefile or other existing file.  Instead of directly editing the
object, you can edit the file by typing @kbd{C-c . e}
(@code{ede-edit-file-target}).  You should ``rescan'' the project
afterwards (@pxref{Miscellaneous commands}).

@node Project Local Variables, EDE Project Features, Customize Features, Modifying your project
@section Project Local Variables

EDE projects can store and manager project local variables.  The
variables are stored in the project, and will be restored when a
project reloads.

Projects which are not stored on disk WILL NOT restore your project
local variables later.

You can use @ref{Customize Features} to of the project to edit the
project local variables.  They are under the 'Settings' group as
``Project Local Variables''.

You can also use @kbd{M-x ede-set} to set a new variable local in the
mini buffer.

In multi-level projects such as Automake and Make generating projects,
project local variables are installed from both the TOP most project,
and the local directory's project.  In that way, you can have some
variables across your whole project, and some specific to a
subdirectory.

You can use project local variables to set any Emacs variable so that
buffers belonging to different projects can have different settings.

NOTE: When you use project-local variables with @ref{ede-cpp-root},
the format is an association list.  For example:

@example
(ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME"
                       :file "/dir/to/some/file"
                       :local-variables
                       '((grep-command . "grep -nHi -e ")
                         (compile-command . "make -f MyCustomMakefile all")))
@end example

@node EDE Project Features,  , Project Local Variables, Modifying your project
@section EDE Project Features

This section details user facing features of an @ede{} @samp{Make}
style project.  An @samp{Automake} project has similar options (but a
direct Automake project does not).

To modify any of the specific features mentioned here, you need to
customize the project or target with @command{customize-project} or
@command{customize-target}.

When you are customizing, you are directly manipulating slot values in
@eieio{} objects.  @xref{Extending EDE}, if you are interested in
additional details.

@node Changing Compilers and Flags, Configurations, EDE Project Features, EDE Project Features
@subsection Changing Compilers and Flags

Targets that build stuff need compilers.  To change compilers, you
need to customize the desired target.

In the @samp{[Make]} section, you can choose a new compiler or linker
from the list.  If a linker you need is not available, you will need
to create a new one.  @xref{Compiler and Linker objects}.

If an existing compiler or linker is close, but you need to modify
some flag set such as adding an include path you will need to add a
configuration variable.

To start, you should create the basic setup, and construct a makefile
with @command{ede-proj-regenerate}.  Look in the @file{Makefile} to
see what commands are inserted.  Once you have determined the variable
you need to modify, you can add a configuration for it.
@xref{Configurations}.

@node Configurations,  , Changing Compilers and Flags, EDE Project Features
@subsection Configurations

Configurations specify different ways to build a project.  For
example, you may configure a project to be in ``debug'' mode, or
perhaps in ``release'' mode.

The project, and each target type all have a slot named
@code{configuration-variables}.  To add new variables to a
configuration find this slot in the custom buffer, and insert a new
configuration.  Name it either ``debug'' or ``release'', then insert
some number of name/value pairs to it.

You can have any number of valid configurations too.  To add a new
configuration, customize your project.  Work in the @samp{[Settings]}
block for ``configurations''.  Add a new named configuration here.

To switch between different active configurations, modify the
``configuration default'' slot.

@node Building and Debugging, Miscellaneous commands, Modifying your project, Top
@chapter Building and Debugging

@ede{} provides the following ``project-aware'' compilation and
debugging commands:

@table @kbd
@item C-c . c
Compile the current target (@code{ede-compile-target}).
@item C-c . C
Compile the entire project (@code{ede-compile-project}).
@item c-c . D
Debug the current target (@code{ede-debug-target}).
@item M-x ede-make-dist
Build a distribution file for your project.
@end table

These commands are also available from the @samp{Development} menu.

@node Miscellaneous commands, Extending EDE, Building and Debugging, Top
@chapter Miscellaneous commands

If you opt to go in and edit @ede{} project files directly---for
instance, by using @kbd{C-c . e} (@pxref{Customize Features})---you
must then ``rescan'' the project files to update the internal data
structures.  To rescan the current project, type @kbd{C-c . g}
(@code{ede-rescan-toplevel}).

@ede{} can help you find files in your project, via the command
@kbd{C-c . f} (@code{ede-find-file}).  This prompts for a file name;
you need not specify the directory.  EDE then tries to visit a file
with that name somewhere in your project.

@ede{} can use external tools to help with file finding.  To do this,
customize @code{ede-locate-setup-options}.

@defvar ede-locate-setup-options
@anchor{ede-locate-setup-options}
List of locate objects to try out by default.
Listed in order of preference.  If the first item cannot be used in
a particular project, then the next one is tried.
It is always assumed that @dfn{ede-locate-base} is at end of the list.
@end defvar

@ede{} also provides a project display mode for the speedbar
(@pxref{Speedbar,,,emacs,GNU Emacs Manual}).  This allows you to view
your source files as they are structured in your project: as a
hierarchical tree, grouped according to target.

To activate the speedbar in this mode, type @kbd{C-c . s}
(@code{ede-speedbar}).

@section Make and Automake projects

A project of @samp{ede-project} type creates a file called
@file{Project.ede} in every project directory.  This is used to track
your configuration information.  If you configure this project to be
in @samp{Makefile} mode, then this project will autogenerate a
@file{Makefile}.  If you configure it in @samp{Automake} mode a
@file{Makefile.am} file will be created.  The automake bootstrapping
routines will also import and maintain a configure.am script and a
host of other files required by Automake.

@node Automake direct projects, Simple projects, Make and Automake projects, Miscellaneous commands
@section Automake direct projects

The project type that reads @file{Makefile.am} directly is derived
from the sources of the original @file{project-am.el} mode that was
distributed independently.  This mode eventually became @ede{}.  The
@samp{project-am} project will read existing automake files, but will
not generate them automatically, or create new ones.  As such, it is
useful as a browsing tool, or as maintenance in managing file lists.

@node Simple projects,  , Automake direct projects, Miscellaneous commands
@section Simple Projects

There is a wide array of simple projects.  In this case a simple
project is one that detects, or is directed to identify a directory as
belonging to a project, but doesn't provide many features of a typical
@ede{} project.  Having the project however allows tools such as
@semantic{} to find sources and perform project level completions.

@subsection ede-cpp-root

The @code{ede-cpp-root} project type allows you to create a single
object with no save-file in your @file{.emacs} file.  It allows @ede{}
to provide the @semantic{} package with the ability to find header
files quickly.

The @code{ede-cpp-root} class knows a few things about C++ projects,
such as the prevalence of "include" directories, and typical
file-layout stuff.  If this isn't sufficient, you can subclass
@code{ede-cpp-root-project} and add your own tweaks in just a few
lines.  See the end of this file for an example.

In the most basic case, add this to your @file{.emacs} file, modifying
appropriate bits as needed.

@example
(ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file")
@end example

Replace @var{SOMENAME} with whatever name you want, and the filename
to an actual file at the root of your project.  It might be a
Makefile, a README file.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  It's just a
key to hang the rest of @ede{} off of.

The most likely reason to create this project, is to speed up
searching for includes files, or to simplify bootstrapping @semantic{}'s
ability to find files without much user interaction.  In conjunction
with @semantic{} completion, having a short include path is key.  You can
override the default include path and system include path like this:

@example
(ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME"
    :include-path '( "/include" "../include" "/c/include" )
    :system-include-path '( "/usr/include/c++/3.2.2/" )
    :compile-command "make compile"
    :spp-table '( ("MOOSE" . "")
                  ("CONST" . "const") ) )
@end example

 In this case each item in the include path list is searched.  If the
directory starts with "/", then that expands to the project root
directory.  If a directory does not start with "/", then it is
relative to the default-directory of the current buffer when the file
name is expanded.

 The include path only affects C/C++ header files.  Use the slot
@code{:header-match-regexp} to change it.

The @code{:system-include-path} allows you to specify absolute names
of include directories where system header files can be found.
These will be applied to files in this project only.

With @code{:compile-command} you can provide a command which should be
run when calling @code{ede-compile-project}.

The @code{:spp-table} provides a list of project specific #define
style macros that are unique to this project, passed in to the
compiler on the command line, or are in special headers.
See the @code{semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map} for more
on how to format this entry.

If there is a single file in your project, you can instead set the
@code{:spp-files} to a list of file names relative to the root of your
project.  Specifying this is like setting the variable
@code{semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file} in semantic.

If you want to override the file-finding tool with your own
function you can do this:

@example
(ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME" :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
@end example

Where @var{MYFCN} is a symbol for a function.  The locate function can
be used in place of @code{ede-expand-filename} so you can quickly
customize your custom target to use specialized local routines instead
of the default @ede{} routines.  The function symbol must take two
arguments:

@table @var
@item NAME
The name of the file to find.
@item DIR
The directory root for this cpp-root project.
@end table

When creating a project with @code{ede-cpp-root}, you can get
additional configurations via @ref{Project Local Variables}.  Be aware
that the format for project local variables is an association list.
You cannot use @kbd{M-x ede-set} and have your project local variables
persist between sessions.

If the cpp-root project style is right for you, but you want a dynamic
loader, instead of hard-coding path name values in your @file{.emacs}, you
can do that too, but you will need to write some lisp code.

To do that, you need to add an entry to the
@code{ede-project-class-files} list, and also provide two functions to
teach @ede{} how to load your project pattern

It would look like this:

@example
(defun MY-FILE-FOR-DIR (&optional dir)
  "Return a full file name to the project file stored in DIR."
  <write your code here, or return nil>
  )

(defun MY-ROOT-FCN ()
  "Return the root fcn for `default-directory'"
  ;; You might be able to use 'ede-cpp-root-project-root'
  ;; and not write this at all.
  )

(defun MY-LOAD (dir)
  "Load a project of type `cpp-root' for the directory DIR.
Return nil if there isn't one."
  ;; Use your preferred construction method here.
  (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file (expand-file-name "FILE" dir)
                               :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
  )

(add-to-list 'ede-project-class-files
             (ede-project-autoload "cpp-root"
              :name "CPP ROOT"
              :file 'ede-cpp-root
              :proj-file 'MY-FILE-FOR-DIR
              :proj-root 'MY-ROOT-FCN
              :load-type 'MY-LOAD
              :class-sym 'ede-cpp-root)
             t)
@end example

This example only creates an auto-loader, and does not create a new kind
of project.

the @code{ede-cpp-root} project type.

@node ede-emacs, ede-linux, ede-cpp-root, Simple projects
@subsection ede-emacs

The @code{ede-emacs} project automatically identifies an Emacs source
tree, and enables EDE project mode for it.

It pre-populates the C Preprocessor symbol map for correct parsing,
and has an optimized include file identification function.

@node ede-linux, ede-generic-project, ede-emacs, Simple projects
@subsection ede-linux

The @code{ede-linux} project will automatically identify a Linux
Kernel source tree, and enable EDE project mode for it.

It pre-populates the C Preprocessor symbol map for reasonable parsing,
and has an optimized include file identification function.

Through the variables @code{project-linux-build-directory-default} and
@code{project-linux-architecture-default}, you can set the build
directory and its architecture, respectively.  The default is to assume that
the build happens in the source directory and to auto-detect the
architecture; if the auto-detection fails, you will be asked.

@node ede-generic-project, Custom Locate, ede-linux, Simple projects
@subsection ede-generic-project

The @code{ede-generic-project} is a project system that makes it easy
to wrap up different kinds of build systems as an EDE project.
Projects such as @ref{ede-emacs} require coding skills to create.
Generic projects also require writing Emacs Lisp code, but the
requirements are minimal.  You can then use
@command{customize-project} to configure build commands, includes, and
other options for that project.  The configuration is saved in
@file{EDEConfig.el}.

Generic projects are disabled by default because they have the
potential to interfere with other projects.  To use the generic
project system to start detecting projects, you need to enable it.

@deffn Command ede-enable-generic-projects
Enable generic project loaders.

This enables generic loaders for projects that are detected using
either a @file{Makefile}, @file{SConstruct}, or @file{CMakeLists}.

You do not need to use this command if you create your own generic
project type.
@end deffn

If you want to create your own generic project loader, you need to
define your own project and target classes, and create an autoloader.
The example for Makefiles looks like this:

@example
;;; MAKEFILE

(defclass ede-generic-makefile-project (ede-generic-project)
  ((buildfile :initform "Makefile")
   )
  "Generic Project for makefiles.")

(defmethod ede-generic-setup-configuration ((proj ede-generic-makefile-project) config)
  "Setup a configuration for Make."
  (oset config build-command "make -k")
  (oset config debug-command "gdb ")
  )

(ede-generic-new-autoloader "generic-makefile" "Make"
			    "Makefile" 'ede-generic-makefile-project)
@end example

This example project will detect any directory with the file
@file{Makefile} in it as belonging to this project type.
Customization of the project will allow you to make build and debug
commands more precise.

@node Custom Locate,  , ede-generic-project, Simple projects
@subsection Custom Locate

The various simple project styles all have one major drawback, which
is that the files in the project are not completely known to EDE@.
When the EDE API is used to try and file files by some reference name
in the project, then that could fail.

@ede{} can therefore use some external locate commands, such as the unix
``locate'' command, or ``GNU Global''.

Configuration of the tool you want to use such as @code{locate}, or
@code{global} will need to be done without the aid of @ede{}.  Once
configured, however, @ede{} can use it.

To enable one of these tools, set the variable
@code{ede-locate-setup-options} with the names of different locate
objects.  @ref{Miscellaneous commands}.

Configure this in your @file{.emacs} before loading in CEDET or EDE@.
If you want to add support for GNU Global, your configuration would
look like this:

@example
(setq ede-locate-setup-options '(ede-locate-global ede-locate-base))
@end example

That way, when a search needs to be done, it will first try using
GLOBAL@.  If global is not available for that directory, then it will
revert to the base locate object.  The base object always fails to
find a file.

You can add your own locate tool but subclassing from
@code{ede-locate-base}.  The subclass should also implement two
methods.  See the code in @file{ede-locate.el} for GNU Global as a
simple example.

@@TODO - Add ID Utils and CScope examples

More on idutils and cscope is in the CEDET manual, and they each have
their own section.

@node Extending EDE, GNU Free Documentation License, Miscellaneous commands, Top
@chapter Extending @ede{}

This chapter is intended for users who want to write new parts or fix
bugs in @ede{}.  A knowledge of Emacs Lisp, and some @eieio{}(CLOS) is
required.

@ede{} uses @eieio{}, the CLOS package for Emacs, to define two object
superclasses, specifically the PROJECT and TARGET@.  All commands in
@ede{} are usually meant to address the current project, or current
target.

All specific projects in @ede{} derive subclasses of the @ede{}
superclasses.  In this way, specific behaviors such as how a project
is saved, or how a target is compiled can be customized by a project
author in detail.  @ede{} communicates to these project objects via an
API using methods.  The commands you use in @ede{} mode are high-level
functional wrappers over these methods.  @xref{Top,,, eieio, EIEIO manual}. For
details on using @eieio{} to extending classes, and writing methods.

If you intend to extend @ede{}, it is most likely that a new target type is
needed in one of the existing project types.  The rest of this chapter
will discuss extending the @code{ede-project} class, and it's targets.
See @file{project-am.el} for basic details on adding targets to it.

For the @code{ede-project} type, the core target class is called
@code{ede-proj-target}.  Inheriting from this will give you everything
you need to start, including adding your sources into the makefile.  If
you also need additional rules in the makefile, you will want to inherit
from @code{ede-proj-target-makefile} instead.  You may want to also add
new fields to track important information.

If you are building currently unsupported code into a program or shared
library, it is unlikely you need a new target at all.  Instead you
would need to create a new compiler or linker object that compiles
source code of the desired type. @ref{Compiler and Linker objects}.

Once your new class exists, you will want to fill in some basic methods.
See the @file{ede-skel.el} file for examples of these.  The files
@file{ede-proj-info.el} and @file{ede-proj-elisp.el} are two interesting
examples.

@node Development Overview, Detecting a Project, Extending EDE, Extending EDE
@section Development Overview

@ede{} is made up of a series of classes implemented with @eieio{}.
These classes define an interface that can be used to create different
types of projects.

@ede{} defines two superclasses which are @code{ede-project} and
@code{ede-target}.  All commands in @ede{} are usually meant to
address the current project, or current target.

All specific projects in @ede{} derive subclasses of the @ede{} superclasses.
In this way, specific behaviors such as how a project is saved, or how a
target is compiled can be customized by a project author in detail.  @ede{}
communicates to these project objects via an API using methods.  The
commands you use in @ede{} mode are high-level functional wrappers over
these methods.

Some example project types are:

@table @code
@item project-am
Automake project which reads existing Automake files.
@item ede-proj-project
This project type will create @file{Makefiles},
or @file{Makefile.am} files to compile your project.
@item ede-linux
This project type will detect linux source trees.
@item ede-emacs
This project will detect an Emacs source tree.
@end table

There are several other project types as well.

The first class you need to know to create a new project type is
@code{ede-project-autoload}.  New instances of this class are needed
to define how Emacs associates different files/buffers with different
project types.  All the autoloads are kept in the variable
@code{ede-project-class-files}.

The next most important class to know is @code{ede-project}.  This is
the baseclass defines how all projects behave.  The basic pattern for
a project is that there is one project per directory, and the topmost
project or directory defines the project as a whole.

Key features of @code{ede-project} are things like name and version
number.  It also holds a list of @code{ede-target} objects and a list
of sub projects, or more @code{ede-project} objects.

New project types must subclass @code{ede-project} to add special
behavior. New project types also need to subclass @code{ede-target} to
add specialty behavior.

In this way, the common @ede{} interface is designed to work against
@code{ede-project}, and thus all subclasses.

@code{ede-project} subclasses @code{ede-project-placeholder}.  This is
the minimum necessary project needed to be cached between runs of
Emacs.  This way, Emacs can track all projects ever seen, without
loading those projects into memory.

Here is a high-level UML diagram for the @ede{} system created with @cogre{}..

@node Detecting a Project, User interface methods, Development Overview, Extending EDE
@section Detecting a Project

Project detection happens with the list of @code{ede-project-autoload}
instances stored in @code{ede-project-class-files}.  The full project
detection scheme works like this:

@table @asis
@item Step 1:
@code{find-file-hook} calls @code{ede-turn-on-hook} on BUFFER.
@item Step 2:
@code{ede-turn-on-hook} turns on @code{ede-minor-mode}
@item Step 3:
@code{ede-minor-mode} looks to see if BUFFER is associated with any
open projects.  If not, it calls @code{ede-load-project-file} to find
a project associated with the current directory BUFFER is in.
@item Step 4:
@code{ede-minor-mode} associates the found project with the current
buffer with a series of variables, such as @code{ede-object}, and
@code{ede-object-project} and @code{ede-object-root-project}.
@end table

Once a buffer is associated, @ede{} minor mode commands will operate
on that buffer.

The function @code{ede-load-project-file} is at the heart of detecting
projects, and it works by looping over all the known project autoload
types in @code{ede-project-autoload} using the utility
@code{ede-directory-project-p}.

The function @code{ede-directory-project-p} will call
@code{ede-dir-to-projectfile} on every @code{ede-project-autoload}
until one of them returns true.  The method
@code{ede-dir-to-projectfile} in turn gets the @code{:proj-file} slot
from the autoload.  If it is a string (i.e., a project file name), it
checks to see if that exists in BUFFER's directory.  If it is a
function, then it calls that function and expects it to return a file
name or @code{nil}.  If the file exists, then this directory is assumed to be
part of a project, and @code{ede-directory-project-p} returns the
instance of @code{ede-project-autoload} that matched.

If the current directory contains the file @code{.ede-ignore} then
that directory is automatically assumed to contain no projects, even
if there is a matching pattern.  Use this type of file in a directory
that may contain many other sub projects, but still has a Makefile of
some sort.

If the current directory is a project, then @ede{} scans upwards till
it finds the top of the project.  It does this by calling
@code{ede-toplevel-project}.  If this hasn't already been discovered,
the directories as scanned upward one at a time until a directory with
no project is found.  The last found project becomes the project
root.  If the found instance of @code{ede-project-autoload} has a
valid @code{proj-root} slot value, then that function is called instead
of scanning the project by hand.  Some project types have a short-cut
for determining the root of a project, so this comes in handy.

Getting back to @code{ede-load-project-file}, this now has an instance
of @code{ede-project-autoload}.  It uses the @code{load-type} slot to
both autoload in the project type, and to create a new instance of the
project type found for the root of the project.  That project is added
to the global list of all projects.  All subprojects are then created
and assembled into the project data structures.


@node User interface methods, Base project methods, Detecting a Project, Extending EDE
@section User interface methods

These methods are core behaviors associated with user commands.
If you do not implement a method, there is a reasonable default that
may do what you need.

@table @code
@item project-add-file
Add a file to your project.  Override this if you want to put new
sources into different fields depending on extension, or other details.
@item project-remove-file
Reverse of project-add-file.
@item project-compile-target
Override this if you want to do something special when the user
"compiles" this target.
@item project-debug-target
What to do when a user wants to debug your target.
@item project-update-version
Easily update the version number of your project.
@item project-edit-file-target
Edit the file the project's information is stored in.
@item project-new-target
Create a new target in a project.
@item project-delete-target
Delete a target from a project.
@item project-make-dist
Make a distribution (tar archive) of the project.
@item project-rescan
Rescan a project file, changing the data in the existing objects.
@end table

@node Base project methods, Sourcecode objects, User interface methods, Extending EDE
@section Base project methods

These methods are important for querying base information from project
and target types:

@table @code
@item ede-name
Return a string that is the name of this target.
@item ede-target-name
Return a string that is the name of the target used by a Make system.
@item ede-description
A brief description of the project or target.  This is currently used
by the @samp{ede-speedbar} interface.
@item ede-want-file-p
Return non-@code{nil} if a target will accept a given file.
It is generally unnecessary to override this.  See the section on source
code.
@item ede-buffer-mine
Return non-@code{nil} if a buffer belongs to this target.  Used during
association when a file is loaded.  It is generally unnecessary to
override this unless you keep auxiliary files.
@end table

These methods are used by the semantic package extensions.
@xref{Top,,, semantic, Semantic manual}.

@table @code
@item ede-buffer-header-file
Return a header file belonging to a given buffer.  Prototypes are place
there when appropriate
@item ede-buffer-documentation-files
Return the documentation file information about this file would be
stored in.
@item ede-documentation
List all documentation a project or target is responsible for.
@end table

@node Sourcecode objects, Compiler and Linker objects, Base project methods, Extending EDE
@section Sourcecode objects

@ede{} projects track source file / target associates via source code
objects.  The definitions for this is in @file{ede-source.el}.  A source
code object contains methods that know how to identify a file as being
of that class, (i.e., a C file ends with @file{.c}).  Some targets can
handle many different types of sources which must all be compiled
together.  For example, a mixed C and C++ program would have
instantiations of both sourcecode types.

When a target needs to know if it will accept a source file, it
references its list of source code objects.  These objects then make
that decision.

Source code objects are stored in the target objects as a list of
symbols, where the symbol's value is the object.  This enables the
project save file mechanism to work.

Here is an example for an instantiation of an Emacs Lisp source code object:

@example
(defvar ede-source-emacs
  (ede-sourcecode "ede-emacs-source"
                  :name "Emacs Lisp"
                  :sourcepattern "\\.el$"
                  :garbagepattern '("*.elc"))
  "Emacs Lisp source code definition.")
@end example

If you want to recycle parts of an existing sourcecode object, you can
clone the original, and then just tweak the parts that are different.
For example:

@example
(defvar ede-source-emacs-autoload
  (clone ede-source-emacs "ede-source-emacs-autoload"
         :name "Emacs Lisp Autoload"
         :sourcepattern "-loaddefs\\.el")
  "Emacs Lisp autoload source code.")
@end example

In this case, the garbage pattern is the same.

@xref{Sourcecode}.

@node Compiler and Linker objects, Project, Sourcecode objects, Extending EDE
@section Compiler and Linker objects

In order for a target to create a @file{Makefile}, it must know how to
compile the sources into the program or desired data file, and
possibly link them together.

A compiler object instantiation is used to associate a given target
with a given source code type.  Some targets can handle many types of
sources, and thus has many compilers available to it.  Some targets
may have multiple compilers for a given type of source code.

@ede{} will examine the actual source files in a target, cross reference
that against the compiler list to come up with the final set of
compilers that will be inserted into the Makefile.

Compiler instantiations must also insert variables specifying the
compiler it plans to use, in addition to creating Automake settings for
@file{configure.ac} when appropriate.

Compiler objects are stored in the target objects as a list of
symbols, where the symbols value is the object.  This enables the
project output mechanism to work more efficiently.

Targets will also have a special "compiler" slot which lets a user
explicitly choose the compiler they want to use.

Here is an example for texinfo:

@example
(defvar ede-makeinfo-compiler
  (ede-compiler
   "ede-makeinfo-compiler"
   :name "makeinfo"
   :variables '(("MAKEINFO" . "makeinfo"))
   :commands '("makeinfo -o $@ $<")
   :autoconf '(("AC_CHECK_PROG" . "MAKEINFO, makeinfo"))
   :sourcetype '(ede-makeinfo-source)
   )
  "Compile texinfo files into info files.")
@end example

@xref{Compilers}.

When creating compiler instantiations, it may be useful to @code{clone}
an existing compiler variable.  Cloning allows you to only modify
parts of the original, while keeping the rest of the same.
Modification of the original will result in the clone also being
changed for shared value slots.

The second important object is the linker class.  The linker is similar
to the compiler, except several compilers might be used to create some
object files, and only one linker is used to link those objects together.

See @file{ede-proj-obj.el} for examples of the combination.

This class implements the @code{ede-cpp-root} project type.
@xref{ede-cpp-root}, for information about using this project type.

@table @asis
@item Slots:

@table @code
@item :include-path
Type: @code{list} @*
Default Value: @code{(quote ("/include" "../include/"))}

The default locate function expands filenames within a project.
If a header file (.h, .hh, etc.)@: name is expanded, and
the @code{:locate-fcn} slot is @code{nil}, then the include path is checked
first, and other directories are ignored.  For very large
projects, this optimization can save a lot of time.

Directory names in the path can be relative to the current
buffer's @code{default-directory} (not starting with a /).  Directories
that are relative to the project's root should start with a /, such
as  "/include", meaning the directory @code{include} off the project root
directory.

@item :system-include-path
Type: @code{list} @*
Default Value: @code{nil}

The system include path for files in this project.
C files initialized in an ede-cpp-root-project have their semantic
system include path set to this value.  If this is @code{nil}, then the
semantic path is not modified.

@item :spp-table
Type: @code{list} @*
Default Value: @code{nil}

C Preprocessor macros for your files.
Preprocessor symbols will be used while parsing your files.
These macros might be passed in through the command line compiler, or
are critical symbols derived from header files.  Providing header files
macro values through this slot improves accuracy and performance.
Use @code{:spp-files} to use these files directly.

@item :spp-files
Type: @code{list} @*
Default Value: @code{nil}

C header file with Preprocessor macros for your files.
The PreProcessor symbols appearing in these files will be used while
parsing files in this project.
See @code{semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map} for more on how this works.

@item :header-match-regexp
Type: @code{string} @*
Default Value: @code{"\\.\\(h\\(h\\|xx\\|pp\\|\\+\\+\\)?\\|H\\)$\\|\\<\\w+$"}

Regexp used to identify C/C++ header files.

@item :locate-fcn
Type: @code{(or null function)} @*
Default Value: @code{nil}

The locate function can be used in place of
@dfn{ede-expand-filename} so you can quickly customize your custom target
to use specialized local routines instead of the EDE routines.
The function symbol must take two arguments:
  NAME - The name of the file to find.
  DIR - The directory root for this cpp-root project.

It should return the fully qualified file name passed in from NAME@.
If that file does not exist, it should return @code{nil}.

Non-@code{nil} to do implement automatic dependencies in the Makefile.

@item :metasubproject
Type: @code{boolean} @*
Default Value: @code{nil}

Non-@code{nil} if this is a metasubproject.
Usually, a subproject is determined by a parent project.  If multiple top level
projects are grouped into a large project not maintained by EDE, then you need
to set this to non-@code{nil}.  The only effect is that the @code{dist} rule will then avoid
making a tar file.

Type: @code{list}

Variables needed in the Makefile for this compiler.
An assoc list where each element is (VARNAME . VALUE) where VARNAME
is a string, and VALUE is either a string, or a list of strings.
For example, GCC would define CC=gcc, and emacs would define EMACS=emacs.

@item :sourcetype
Type: @code{list}

A list of @code{ede-sourcecode} @xref{ede-sourcecode}. objects this class will handle.
This is used to match target objects with the compilers and linkers
they can use, and which files this object is interested in.

@item :commands
Type: @code{list}

The commands used to execute this compiler.
The object which uses this compiler will place these commands after
it's rule definition.

@item :objectextention
Type: @code{string}

A string which is the extension used for object files.
For example, C code uses .o on unix, and Emacs Lisp uses .elc.
