@kindex C-x m
@findex compose-mail
  To send an @dfn{e-mail} message in Emacs, type @kbd{C-x m}.  This
selects and initializes a buffer named @samp{*mail*}, where you can
edit the text and headers of the message.  Finally, type @kbd{C-c C-s}
or @kbd{C-c C-c} to send the message.

@table @kbd
@item C-x m
Begin composing mail (@code{compose-mail}).
@item C-x 4 m
Likewise, in another window (@code{compose-mail-other-window}).
@item C-x 5 m
Likewise, but in a new frame (@code{compose-mail-other-frame}).
@item C-c C-s
In the mail buffer, send the message (@code{message-send}).
@item C-c C-c
In the mail buffer, send the message and bury the buffer
(@code{message-send-and-exit}).
@end table

@kindex C-x 4 m
@findex compose-mail-other-window
@kindex C-x 5 m
@findex compose-mail-other-frame
@noindent
The command @kbd{C-x 4 m} (@code{compose-mail-other-window}) does the
same as @kbd{C-x m}, except it displays the mail buffer in a different
window.  The command @kbd{C-x 5 m} (@code{compose-mail-other-frame})
creates a new frame for the mail buffer.

  Because the mail buffer is an ordinary Emacs buffer, you can switch
to other buffers while in the middle of composing mail, and switch
back later (or never).  If you type @kbd{C-x m} again when you have
been composing another message but have not sent it, Emacs asks for
confirmation before erasing the old message.  If you answer @kbd{n},
Emacs selects the mail buffer with its old contents, so you can finish
the old message and send it.  @kbd{C-u C-x m} is another way to do
this.  Sending the message marks the mail buffer ``unmodified,'' which
avoids the need for confirmation when @kbd{C-x m} is next used.

  If you want to send another message before finishing the current
message, use the command @kbd{M-x rename-uniquely} to rename the
current mail buffer (@pxref{Misc Buffer}).  Then you can use @kbd{C-x
m} to make a new mail buffer, and work with each mail buffer
independently.

  Before using Emacs to send mail, you may need to customize the
variable @code{send-mail-function} if your system is not set up to
deliver mail directly via SMTP (@pxref{Mail Sending}).  In addition,
you may need to customize @code{user-mail-address} if the system
cannot receive mail via SMTP (@pxref{Mail Headers}).

@node Mail Format
@section The Format of the Mail Buffer

  An email message must contain certain pieces of information, called
@dfn{headers}, which specify the message's sender, recipient(s), and
so on.

  At the top of the mail buffer is a set of @dfn{header fields}, where
you can enter this information.  You can insert and edit header fields
using ordinary editing commands.  @xref{Header Editing}, for commands
specific to editing header fields.

  Some header fields are automatically pre-initialized in the buffer,
when appropriate; other headers, such as @samp{Date} and
@samp{Message-Id}, are normally omitted from the mail buffer and
created automatically when the message is sent.

@vindex mail-header-separator
  The line in the buffer that says

@smallexample
--text follows this line--
@end smallexample

@noindent
separates the header fields from the @dfn{body} (or @dfn{text}) of the
message.  Everything above this line is treated as part of the
headers; everything below it is treated as the body.  The delimiter
line itself does not appear in the message actually sent.  The text
used for the delimiter line is controlled by the variable
@code{mail-header-separator}.

  Here is an example of what the headers and text in the mail buffer
might look like.

@example
To: gnu@@example.org
CC: lungfish@@example.com, byob@@example.net
Subject: The Emacs Manual
--text follows this line--
Please ignore this message.
@end example

@node Mail Headers
@section Mail Header Fields
@cindex headers (of mail message)

  A header field in the mail buffer starts with a field name at the
beginning of a line, terminated by a colon.  Upper and lower case are
equivalent in field names (and in mailing addresses also).  After the
colon and optional whitespace comes the contents of the field.

  You can use any name you like for a header field, but normally
people use only standard field names with accepted meanings.  Here is
a table of commonly-used fields.  Emacs pre-initializes some of these,
depending on various options you can set.  You can delete or alter any
header field before you send the message, if you wish.

@table @samp
@item From
@vindex user-mail-address
The address of the sender (you).  This should be a valid mailing
address, as replies will normally go there.  Emacs initializes this
field using the variables @code{user-full-name} and
@code{user-mail-address}; see below.

@item To
The mailing address(es) to which the message is addressed.  To list
more than one address, use commas (not spaces) to separate them.

@item Subject
A piece of text saying what the message is about.  Most mail-reading
programs can display a summary of messages, listing the subject of
each message but not its text.

@item CC
Additional mailing address(es) to send the message to.  This is like
@samp{To}, except that these readers should not regard the message as
directed at them.

@item BCC
Additional mailing address(es) to send the message to, which should
not appear in the header of the message actually sent.  ``BCC'' stands
for @dfn{blind carbon copies}.

@item FCC
The name of one file, to which a copy of the sent message should be
appended.  Emacs writes the message in mbox format, unless the file is
in Babyl format (used by Rmail before Emacs 23), in which case Emacs
writes Babyl.  If an Rmail buffer is visiting the file, Emacs updates
it accordingly.  To specify more than one file, use several @samp{FCC}
fields, with one file name in each field.

@item Reply-to
An address to which replies should be sent, instead of @samp{From}.
You can use this header if, for some reason, your @samp{From} address
is unable to receive replies.

@item Mail-reply-to
  This field takes precedence over @samp{Reply-to}.  It is used because
some mailing lists set the @samp{Reply-to} field for their own purposes
(a somewhat controversial practice).

@item Mail-followup-to
  This field contains one or more addresses.  It is typically used when
you reply to a message from a mailing list that you are subscribed to.
It usually indicates that you want replies to go to the list, and that
you do not need an extra copy sent directly to you.

@c Message mode handles this differently...
@c @vindex mail-mailing-lists
@c   The variable @code{mail-mailing-lists} holds a list of mailing list
@c addresses that you are subscribed to.  If it is non-@code{nil}, Emacs
@c inserts an appropriate @samp{Mail-followup-to} header when sending mail
@c to a mailing list.

@item In-reply-to
A piece of text describing the message you are replying to.  Some mail
systems can use this information to correlate related pieces of mail.
Normally, you never need to think about this, because it is filled in
automatically when you reply to a message in Rmail (or any other mail
program built into Emacs).

@item References
The Message-Ids of previous related messages (a Message-Id is a unique
identifier generated when a message is sent).  Like
@samp{In-reply-to}, this is normally set up automatically for you.
@end table

@noindent
The @samp{To}, @samp{CC}, and @samp{BCC} fields can appear any number
of times, and each such header field can contain multiple addresses,
separated by commas.  This way, you can specify any number of places
to send the message.  These fields can also have continuation lines:
one or more lines starting with whitespace, following the starting
line of the field, are considered part of the field.  Here's an
example of a @samp{To} field with a continuation line:

@example
@group
To: foo@@example.net, this@@example.net,
  bob@@example.com
@end group
@end example

@vindex user-full-name
@vindex user-mail-address
  The default contents of the @samp{From} header field are computed
from the variables @code{user-full-name} and @code{user-mail-address}.
On some operating systems, Emacs initializes these two variables using
environment variables (@pxref{General Variables}).  If this
information is unavailable or wrong, you can customize the variables
yourself (@pxref{Easy Customization}).

@vindex mail-from-style
  The value of the variable @code{mail-from-style} specifies how to
format the address in the @samp{From} field:

@table @asis
@item @code{nil}
Use just the address, as in @samp{king@@grassland.com}.
@item @code{parens}
Use both address and full name, as in:@*
@samp{king@@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)}.
@item @code{angles}
Use both address and full name, as in:@*
@samp{Elvis Parsley <king@@grassland.com>}.
@item any other value
Use @code{angles} for most addresses.  However, if the address must be
``quoted'' to remain syntactically-valid under the @code{angles}
format but not under the @code{parens} format, use @code{parens}
instead.  This is the default.
@end table

@c There is also mail-specify-envelope-from and mail-envelope-from, but
@c these are probably not topics for the Emacs manual.

@vindex mail-default-headers
  You can direct Emacs to insert certain default headers into the mail
buffer by setting the variable @code{mail-default-headers} to a
string.  Then @kbd{C-x m} inserts this string into the message
headers.  For example, here is how to add a @samp{Reply-to} and
@samp{FCC} header to each message:

@smallexample
(setq mail-default-headers
      "Reply-to: foo@@example.com\nFCC: ~/Mail/sent")
@end smallexample

@noindent
If the default header fields are not appropriate for a
particular message, edit them as necessary before sending the message.

@node Mail Aliases
@section Mail Aliases
@cindex mail aliases
@cindex @file{.mailrc} file
@cindex mailrc file
@vindex mail-personal-alias-file

  You can define @dfn{mail aliases}, which are short mnemonic names
that stand for mail addresses or groups of mail addresses.  By
default, mail aliases are defined in the file @file{~/.mailrc}.  You
can specify a different file name to use, by setting the variable
@code{mail-personal-alias-file}.

  To define an alias in @file{.mailrc}, write a line in the following
format:

@example
alias @var{nick} @var{fulladdresses}
@end example

@noindent
This means that @var{nick} should expand into @var{fulladdresses},
where @var{fulladdresses} can be either a single address, or multiple
addresses separated with spaces.  For instance, to make @code{maingnu}
stand for @code{gnu@@gnu.org} plus a local address of your own, put in
this line:@refill

@example
alias maingnu gnu@@gnu.org local-gnu
@end example

@noindent
If an address contains a space, quote the whole address with a pair of
double quotes, like this:

@example
alias jsmith "John Q. Smith <none@@example.com>"
@end example

@noindent
Note that you need not include double quotes around individual parts
of the address, such as the person's full name.  Emacs puts them in if
they are needed.  For instance, it inserts the above address as
@samp{"John Q. Smith" <none@@example.com>}.

  Emacs also recognizes ``include'' commands in @file{.mailrc}.  They
look like this:

@example
source @var{filename}
@end example

@noindent
The @file{.mailrc} file is not unique to Emacs; many other
mail-reading programs use it for mail aliases, and it can contain
various other commands.  However, Emacs ignores everything except
alias definitions and include commands.

@findex mail-abbrev-insert-alias
  Mail aliases expand as abbrevs---that is to say, as soon as you type
a word-separator character after an alias (@pxref{Abbrevs}).  This
expansion takes place only within the @samp{To}, @samp{From},
@samp{CC}, @samp{BCC}, and @samp{Reply-to} header fields (plus their
@samp{Resent-} variants); it does not take place in other header
fields, such as @samp{Subject}.

  You can also insert an aliased address directly, using the command
@kbd{M-x mail-abbrev-insert-alias}.  This reads an alias name, with
completion, and inserts its definition at point.

@node Mail Commands
@section Mail Commands
@cindex Message mode
@cindex mode, Message

  The default major mode for the @samp{*mail*} buffer is called
Message mode.  It behaves like Text mode in many ways, but provides
several additional commands on the @kbd{C-c} prefix, which make
editing a message more convenient.

  In this section, we will describe some of the most commonly-used
commands available in Message mode.
@ifnottex
Message mode also has its own manual, where its features are described
in greater detail.  @xref{Top,,Message, message, Message}.

@end menu

@node Mail Sending
@subsection Mail Sending

  There are two commands to send a message you have been editing:

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-c
Send the message, and deselect the mail buffer (@code{message-send-and-exit}).
@item C-c C-s
Send the message, and leave the mail buffer selected (@code{message-send}).
@end table

@kindex C-c C-s @r{(Message mode)}
@kindex C-c C-c @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-send
  If you want to send a message and be done with it, type @kbd{C-c
C-c} (@code{mail-send-and-exit}).  This sends the message and then
either deletes the window or switches to another buffer.  It also
``buries'' the mail buffer, putting it at the lowest priority for
reselection.  This is the usual command for sending a message.

@findex message-send-and-exit
  The command @kbd{C-c C-s} (@code{message-send}) sends the message
and marks the mail buffer unmodified, but leaves the buffer selected.
Use this command if you want to modify the message (perhaps with new
recipients) and send it again.

@vindex message-send-hook
  Sending a message runs the hook @code{message-send-hook}.

  In a file-visiting buffer, sending the message does not clear the
modified flag, because only saving the file should do that.  Also, you
don't get a warning if you try to send the same message twice.

@vindex sendmail-coding-system
  When you send a message containing non-@acronym{ASCII} characters,
they need to be encoded with a coding system (@pxref{Coding Systems}).
Usually the coding system is specified automatically by your chosen
language environment (@pxref{Language Environments}).  You can
explicitly specify the coding system for outgoing mail by setting the
variable @code{sendmail-coding-system} (@pxref{Recognize Coding}).  If
the coding system thus determined does not handle the characters in a
particular message, Emacs asks you to select the coding system to use,
showing a list of possible coding systems.

@cindex SMTP
@cindex Feedmail
@cindex Sendmail
@cindex Mailclient
@vindex send-mail-function
  The variable @code{send-mail-function} controls how the default mail
user agent sends mail.  Its value should be a function, which can be
one of the following:

@table @code
@item sendmail-send-it
Send mail using the system's default @command{sendmail} (or
@command{sendmail}-compatible) program.  This is the default on Unix
and GNU, and works provided the system is a valid @dfn{mail host}
(that is, provided it can deliver mail via SMTP).

@item mailclient-send-it
Pass the mail buffer on to the system's designated mail client (see
@file{mailclient.el}).  This is the default on Mac OS X and
MS-Windows.

@item smtpmail-send-it
Send mail through an external mail host (e.g., your Internet service
provider's SMTP server).  You will need to tell Emacs how to contact
the SMTP server, by customizing the variables
@code{smtpmail-smtp-server} and @code{smtpmail-auth-credentials}.
@xref{Top,,Emacs SMTP Library, smtpmail, Sending mail via SMTP}.

@item feedmail-send-it
This is similar to @code{sendmail-send-it}, but allows you to queue
messages for later sending.  See the commentary section in the file
@file{feedmail.el} for more information.
@end table

@node Header Editing
@subsection Mail Header Editing

  Message mode provides the following special commands to move to
particular header fields and to complete addresses in headers.

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-f C-t
Move to the @samp{To} header (@code{message-goto-to}).
@item C-c C-f C-s
Move to the @samp{Subject} header (@code{message-goto-subject}).
@item C-c C-f C-c
Move to the @samp{CC} header (@code{message-goto-cc}).
@item C-c C-f C-b
Move to the @samp{BCC} header (@code{message-goto-bcc}).
@item C-c C-f C-r
Move to the @samp{Reply-To} header (@code{message-goto-reply-to}).
@item C-c C-f C-f
Move to the @samp{Mail-Followup-To} header field
(@code{message-goto-followup-to}).
@item C-c C-f C-w
Add a new @samp{FCC} header field, with file-name completion
(@code{message-goto-fcc}).
@item C-c C-b
Move to the start of the message body (@code{message-goto-body}).
@item @key{TAB}
Complete a mailing address (@code{message-tab}).
@end table

@kindex C-c C-f C-t @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-goto-to
@kindex C-c C-f C-s @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-goto-subject
@kindex C-c C-f C-c @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-goto-cc
@kindex C-c C-f C-b @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-goto-bcc
@kindex C-c C-f C-r @r{(Message mode)}
@findex goto-reply-to
@kindex C-c C-f C-f @r{(Message mode)}
@findex goto-followup-to
@kindex C-c C-f C-w @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-goto-fcc
  The commands to move point to particular header fields are all based
on the prefix @kbd{C-c C-f} (@samp{C-f} is for ``field'').  If the
field in question does not exist, the command creates one (the
exception is @code{mail-fcc}, which creates a new field each time).

@kindex C-c C-b @r{(Message mode)}
@findex mail-text
  The command @kbd{C-c C-b} (@code{message-goto-body}) moves point to
just after the header separator line---that is, to the beginning of
the body.

@findex message-tab
@kindex TAB @r{(Message mode)}
  While editing a header field that contains addresses, such as
@samp{To:}, @samp{CC:} and @samp{BCC:}, you can complete an address by
typing @key{TAB} (@code{message-tab}).  This attempts to insert the
full name corresponding to the address based on a couple of methods,
including EUDC, a library that recognizes a number of directory server
protocols (@pxref{Top,,EUDC,eudc, The Emacs Unified Directory
Client}).  Failing that, it attempts to expand the address as a mail
alias (@pxref{Mail Aliases}).  If point is on a header field that does
not take addresses, or if it is in the message body, then @key{TAB}
just inserts a tab character.

@node Citing Mail
@subsection Citing Mail
@cindex citing mail

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-y
Yank the selected message from Rmail (@code{message-yank-original}).
@item C-c C-q
Fill each paragraph cited from another message
(@code{message-fill-yanked-message}).
@end table

@kindex C-c C-y @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-yank-original
@findex message-yank-prefix
  You can use the command @kbd{C-c C-y} (@code{message-yank-original})
to @dfn{cite} a message that you are replying to.  This inserts the
text of that message into the mail buffer.  This command is active
only when the mail buffer is invoked from a mail program running in
Emacs, such as Rmail.

  By default, Emacs inserts the string @samp{>} in front of each line
of the cited text; this prefix string is specified by the variable
@code{message-yank-prefix}.  If you call @code{message-yank-original}
with a prefix argument, the citation prefix is not inserted.

@kindex C-c C-q @r{(Message mode)}
@findex mail-fill-yanked-message
  After using @kbd{C-c C-y}, you can type @kbd{C-c C-q}
(@code{message-fill-yanked-message}) to fill the paragraphs of the
cited message.  One use of @kbd{C-c C-q} fills all such paragraphs,
each one individually.  To fill a single paragraph of the quoted
message, use @kbd{M-q}.  If filling does not automatically handle the
type of citation prefix you use, try setting the fill prefix
explicitly.  @xref{Filling}.

@vindex mail-citation-hook
  You can customize mail citation through the hook
@code{mail-citation-hook}.  For example, you can use the Supercite
package, which provides more flexible citation
(@pxref{Introduction,,,sc, Supercite}).

@node Mail Misc
@subsection Mail Miscellany

@kindex C-c C-a @r{(Message mode)}
@findex mail-attach-file
@cindex MIME
@cindex Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
  You can @dfn{attach} a file to an outgoing message by typing
@kbd{C-c C-a} (@code{mml-attach-file}) in the mail buffer.  Attaching
is done using the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard.

  The @code{mml-attach-file} command prompts for the name of the file,
and for the attachment's @dfn{content type}, @dfn{description}, and
@dfn{disposition}.  The content type is normally detected
automatically; just type @key{RET} to accept the default.  The
description is a single line of text that the recipient will see next
to the attachment; you may also choose to leave this empty.  The
disposition is either @samp{inline} (the default), which means the
recipient will see a link to the attachment within the message body,
or @samp{attachment}, which means the link will be separate from the
body.

  The actual contents of the attached file are not inserted into the
mail buffer.  Instead, some placeholder text is inserted into the mail
buffer, like this:

@smallexample
<#part type="text/plain" filename="~/foo.txt" disposition=inline>
<#/part>
@end smallexample

@noindent
When you type @kbd{C-c C-c} or @kbd{C-c C-s} to send the message, the
attached file will be delivered with it.

@findex ispell-message
  While composing a message, you can do spelling correction on the
message text by typing @kbd{M-x ispell-message}.  If you have yanked
an incoming message into the outgoing draft, this command skips what
was yanked, but it checks the text that you yourself inserted (it
looks for indentation or @code{mail-yank-prefix} to distinguish the
cited lines from your input).  @xref{Spelling}.

@vindex mail-mode-hook
@vindex mail-setup-hook
  Turning on Message mode (which @kbd{C-x m} does automatically) runs
the normal hooks @code{text-mode-hook} and @code{message-mode-hook}.
Initializing a new outgoing message runs the normal hook
@code{message-setup-hook}; you can use this hook if you want to make
changes to the appearance of the mail buffer.  @xref{Hooks}.

  The main difference between these hooks is just when they are
invoked.  Whenever you type @kbd{C-x m}, @code{message-mode-hook} runs
as soon as the mail buffer is created.  Then the @code{message-setup}
function inserts the default contents of the buffer.  After these
default contents are inserted, @code{message-setup-hook} runs.

  If you use @kbd{C-x m} to continue an existing composition,
@code{message-mode-hook} runs immediately after switching to the mail
buffer.  If the buffer is unmodified, or if you decide to erase it and
start again, @code{message-setup-hook} runs after the default contents
are inserted.

@node Mail Signature
@section Mail Signature

@cindex mail signature
@vindex mail-signature-file
@vindex mail-signature
  You can add a standard piece of text---your @dfn{mail
signature}---to the end of every message.  This signature may contain
information such as your telephone number or your physical location.
The variable @code{mail-signature} determines how Emacs handles the
mail signature.

  The default value of @code{mail-signature} is @code{t}; this means
to look for your mail signature in the file @file{~/.signature}.  If
this file exists, its contents are automatically inserted into the end
of the mail buffer.  You can change the signature file via the
variable @code{mail-signature-file}.

  If you change @code{mail-signature} to a string, that specifies the
text of the signature directly.

@kindex C-c C-w @r{(Message mode)}
@findex message-insert-signature
  If you change @code{mail-signature} to @code{nil}, Emacs will not
insert your mail signature automatically.  You can insert your mail
signature by typing @kbd{C-c C-w} (@code{message-insert-signature}) in
the mail buffer.  Emacs will look for your signature in the signature
file.

  By convention, a mail signature should be marked by a line whose
contents are @samp{-- }.  If your signature lacks this prefix, it is
added for you.  The remainder of your signature should be no more than
four lines.

@node Mail Amusements
@section Mail Amusements

@findex spook
@cindex NSA
  @kbd{M-x spook} adds a line of randomly chosen keywords to an outgoing
mail message.  The keywords are chosen from a list of words that suggest
you are discussing something subversive.

  The idea behind this feature is the suspicion that the
NSA@footnote{The US National Security Agency.} and other intelligence
agencies snoop on all electronic mail messages that contain keywords
suggesting they might find them interesting.  (The agencies say that
they don't, but that's what they @emph{would} say.)  The idea is that if
lots of people add suspicious words to their messages, the agencies will
get so busy with spurious input that they will have to give up reading
it all.  Whether or not this is true, it at least amuses some people.

@findex fortune-to-signature
@cindex fortune cookies
  You can use the @code{fortune} program to put a ``fortune cookie''
message into outgoing mail.  To do this, add
@code{fortune-to-signature} to @code{mail-setup-hook}:

@example
(add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'fortune-to-signature)
@end example

@noindent
You will probably need to set the variable @code{fortune-file} before
using this.

@cindex Message mode for sending mail
  In this chapter we have described the usual Emacs mode for editing
and sending mail---Message mode.  This is only one of several
available modes.  Prior to Emacs 23.2, the default mode was Mail mode,
which is similar to Message mode in many respects but lacks features
such as MIME support.  Another available mode is MH-E
(@pxref{Top,,MH-E,mh-e, The Emacs Interface to MH}).

@vindex mail-user-agent
  You can choose any of these @dfn{mail user agents} as your preferred
method for editing and sending mail.  The commands @code{C-x m},
@code{C-x 4 m} and @code{C-x 5 m} use whichever agent you have
specified; so do various other parts of Emacs that send mail, such as
the bug reporter (@pxref{Bugs}).  To specify a mail user agent,
customize the variable @code{mail-user-agent}.  Currently, legitimate
values include @code{message-user-agent} (Message mode)
@code{sendmail-user-agent} (Mail mode), @code{gnus-user-agent}, and
@code{mh-e-user-agent}.

  If you select a different mail-composition method, the information
in this chapter about the mail buffer and Message mode does not apply;
the other methods use a different format of text in a different
buffer, and their commands are different as well.

@vindex read-mail-command
  Similarly, to specify your preferred method for reading mail,
customize the variable @code{read-mail-command}.  The default is
@code{rmail} (@pxref{Rmail}).
