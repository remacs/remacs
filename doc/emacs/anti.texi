@appendix Emacs 22 Antinews

  For those users who live backwards in time, here is information
about downgrading to Emacs version 22.3.  We hope you will enjoy the
greater simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs
@value{EMACSVER} features.

@itemize @bullet

@item
The Fontconfig font library is no longer supported.  To specify a
font, you must use an XLFD (X Logical Font Descriptor).  The other
ways of specifying fonts---so-called ``Fontconfig'' and ``GTK'' font
names---are clearly redundant, and have been removed.

@item
We have switched to a character representation specially designed for
Emacs.  Rather than forcing all the widely used scripts artificially
into alignment, like Unicode does, Emacs treats them all equally,
giving each one a place in the space of character codes.  Thus,
scripts do not need to fight over characters used in each one of them,
as each has its own variant, and they all are different as far as
Emacs is concerned.  For example, there's a Latin-1 c-cedilla
character, and there's a Latin-2 c-cedilla; searching a buffer for the
Latin-1 variant will only find that variant, but not the others.  This
design allows us to get rid of a confusing situation in Emacs 23,
whereby a character can simultaneously belong to any number of
charsets.

@item
Emacs now uses an internal encoding, known as @samp{emacs-mule}, which
is peculiar to Emacs and does not map easily into any of the existing
character encodings, including Unicode.  This was imperative to
support several different variants of the same character, each one
belonging to its own script: @samp{emacs-mule} marks each character
with its script, to better discern them from one another.

@item
For simplicity, the functions @code{encode-coding-region} and
@code{decode-coding-region} no longer accept an argument saying where
to store the result of their conversions.  The result always replaces
the original, so there's no need to look for it elsewhere.

@item
Emacs no longer performs font anti-aliasing.  If your fonts look ugly,
try choosing a larger font and increasing the screen resolution.
Admittedly, this becomes difficult as you go further back in time,
since available screen resolutions will decrease.

@item
Emacs has added support for some soon-to-be-non-obsolete platforms.
These include GNU/Linux systems based on libc version 5, BSD systems
based on the COFF executable format, Solaris versions less than 2.6,
and many more.

@item
Emacs can no longer display frames on X windows and text terminals
(ttys) simultaneously.  If you start Emacs as an X application, the
Emacs job can only create X frames; if you start Emacs on a tty, the
Emacs job can only use that tty.  No more confusion about which type
of frame will @command{emacsclient} use in any given Emacs session!

@item
Emacs can no longer be started as a daemon.  We decided that having an
Emacs sitting silently in the background with no visual manifestation
anywhere in sight is too confusing.

@item
Transient Mark mode is now disabled by default.  Furthermore, some
commands that operate specifically on the region when it is active and
Transient Mark mode is enabled (such as @code{fill-paragraph}
@code{ispell-word}, and @code{indent-for-tab-command}), no longer do
so.

@item
The line motion commands, @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-p}, now move by logical
text lines, not screen lines.  Even if a long text line is continued
over multiple screen lines, @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-p} treat it as a
single line, because that's ultimately what it is.

@item
Visual Line mode, which provides ``word wrap'' functionality, has been
removed.  You can still use Long Lines mode to gain an approximation
of word wrapping, though this has some drawbacks---for instance,
syntax highlighting often doesn't work well on wrapped lines.

@item
The variable @code{shift-select-mode} has been deleted; holding
@key{shift} while typing a motion command no longer creates a
temporarily active region.  You can still create temporarily active
regions by dragging the mouse.

@item
@kbd{C-l} now runs @code{recenter} instead of
@code{recenter-top-bottom}.  This always sets the current line at the
center of the window, instead of cycling through the center, top, and
bottom of the window on successive invocations of @kbd{C-l}.  This
lets you type @kbd{C-l C-l C-l C-l} to be @emph{absolutely sure} that
you have recentered the line.

@item
Typing @kbd{M-n} at the start of the minibuffer history list no longer
attempts to generate guesses of possible minibuffer input.  It instead
does the straightforward thing, by issuing the message @samp{End of
history; no default available}.

@item
Individual buffers can no longer display faces specially.  The text
scaling commands @kbd{C-x C-+}, @kbd{C-x C--}, and @kbd{C-x C-0} have
been removed, and so has the buffer face menu bound to
@kbd{S-down-mouse-1}.

@item
VC no longer supports fileset-based operations on distributed version
control systems (DVCSs) such as Arch, Bazaar, Subversion, Mercurial,
and Git.  For instance, multi-file commits will be performed by
committing one file at a time.  As you go further back in time, we
will remove DVCS support entirely, so start migrating your projects to
CVS.

@item
To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space, many
other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 22.3.
