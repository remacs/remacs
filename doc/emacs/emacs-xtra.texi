@node Introduction
@unnumbered Introduction

This manual contains detailed information about various features that
are too specialized to be included in the printed Emacs manual.  It is
intended to be readable by anyone having a basic knowledge of Emacs.
However, certain sections may be intended for a more specialized
audience, such as Elisp authors.  This should be clearly pointed out
at the beginning of these sections.

@c Note to authors - you need to be careful about cross-references to
@c topics in the Emacs manual.  As a printed document, the xtra files
@c are separate from the Emacs manual; but as an info document, they
@c are part of the Emacs manual.  Hence you need to use something like:
@c @iftex
@c @ref{Comparing Files,,, emacs, the Emacs Manual},
@c @end iftex
@c @ifnottex
@c @ref{Comparing Files},
@c @end ifnottex

Certain packages (or collections of related features) have their own
manuals, separate from the main Emacs manual.  This manual is
intended as a complement, rather than an alternative, to reading those
additional manuals.  In a nutshell, it is a collection of smaller
specialized features (or extra detail about standard features), too
small or too obscure to justify their own manual, or inclusion in the
printed Emacs manual.  The chapters in this manual are, however,
included (at the relevant places) in the main Emacs manual when it is
formatted as an Info document.

Sections intended specifically for Elisp programmers can follow the
style of the Elisp manual.  Other sections should follow the style of
the Emacs manual.
