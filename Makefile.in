# DIST: This is the distribution Makefile for Emacs.  configure can
# DIST: make most of the changes to this file you might want, so try
# DIST: that first.

# make all	to compile and build Emacs.
# make install	to install it.
# make TAGS	to update tags tables.
#
# make clean  or  make mostlyclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
# 
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
# 
# make maintainer-clean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files
#      produced by Bison, tags tables, info files, and so on.
#
# make extraclean
#      Still more severe - delete backup and autosave files, too.

# ==================== Where To Install Things ====================

# The default location for installation.  Everything is placed in
# subdirectories of this directory.  The default values for many of
# the variables below are expressed in terms of this one, so you may
# not need to change them.  This defaults to /usr/local.
prefix=@prefix@

# Like `prefix', but used for architecture-specific files.
exec_prefix=@exec_prefix@

# Where to install Emacs and other binaries that people will want to
# run directly (like etags).
bindir=@bindir@

# Where to install architecture-independent data files.	 ${lispdir}
# and ${etcdir} are subdirectories of this.
datadir=@datadir@

# Where to install and expect the files that Emacs modifies as it
# runs.	 These files are all architecture-independent. Right now, the
# only such data is the locking directory; ${lockdir} is a
# subdirectory of this.
sharedstatedir=@sharedstatedir@

# Where to install and expect executable files to be run by Emacs
# rather than directly by users, and other architecture-dependent
# data.	 ${archlibdir} is a subdirectory of this.
libexecdir=@libexecdir@

# Where to install Emacs's man pages, and what extension they should have.
mandir=@mandir@
manext=.1

# Where to install and expect the info files describing Emacs.	In the
# past, this defaulted to a subdirectory of ${prefix}/lib/emacs, but
# since there are now many packages documented with the texinfo
# system, it is inappropriate to imply that it is part of Emacs.
infodir=@infodir@

# Where to look for bitmap files.
bitmapdir=@bitmapdir@

# Where to find the source code.  The source code for Emacs's C kernel is
# expected to be in ${srcdir}/src, and the source code for Emacs's
# utility programs is expected to be in ${srcdir}/lib-src.  This is

# ==================== Emacs-specific directories ====================

# These variables hold the values Emacs will actually use.  They are
# based on the values of the standard Make variables above.

# Where to install the lisp files distributed with
# Emacs.  This includes the Emacs version, so that the
# lisp files for different versions of Emacs will install
# themselves in separate directories.
lispdir=@lispdir@

# Directories Emacs should search for lisp files specific
# to this site (i.e. customizations), before consulting
# ${lispdir}.  This should be a colon-separated list of
# directories.
locallisppath=@locallisppath@

# Where Emacs will search to find its lisp files.  Before
# changing this, check to see if your purpose wouldn't
# better be served by changing locallisppath.  This
# should be a colon-separated list of directories.
lisppath=@lisppath@

# Where Emacs will search for its lisp files while
# building.  This is only used during the process of
# compiling Emacs, to help Emacs find its lisp files
# before they've been installed in their final location.
# It's usually identical to lisppath, except that 
# it does not include locallisppath, and the
# entry for the directory containing the installed lisp
# files has been replaced with ../lisp.  This should be a
# colon-separated list of directories.
buildlisppath=${srcdir}/lisp

# Where to install the other architecture-independent
# data files distributed with Emacs (like the tutorial,
# the cookie recipes and the Zippy database). This path
# usually contains the Emacs version number, so the data
# files for multiple versions of Emacs may be installed
# at once.
etcdir=@etcdir@

# Where to create and expect the locking directory, where
# the Emacs locking code keeps track of which files are
# currently being edited.
lockdir=@lockdir@

# Where to put executables to be run by Emacs rather than
# the user.  This path usually includes the Emacs version
# and configuration name, so that multiple configurations
# for multiple versions of Emacs may be installed at
# once.
archlibdir=@archlibdir@

# Where to put the docstring file.

###      `configure' even if `configure' can be remade using a rule in the

### Unlocking and relocking.  The idea of these productions is to reduce
### hassles when installing an incremental tar of Emacs.  Do `make unlock'
### before unlocking the file to take the write locks off all sources so
### that tar xvof will overwrite them without fuss.  Then do `make relock'
### afterward so that VC mode will know which files should be checked in
### if you want to mung them.
###
### Note: it's no disaster if these productions miss a file or two; tar
### and VC will swiftly let you know if this happens, and it is easily
### corrected.
