# DIST: This is the distribution Makefile for Emacs.  configure can
# DIST: make most of the changes to this file you might want, so try
# DIST: that first.

# make all	to compile and build Emacs.
# make install	to install it.
# make TAGS	to update tags tables.
#
# make clean  or  make mostlyclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
# 
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
# 
# make realclean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files
#      produced by Bison, tags tables, info files, and so on.
#
# make extraclean
#      Still more severe - delete backup and autosave files, too.

# ==================== Where To Install Things ====================

# The default location for installation.  Everything is placed in

# the variables below are expressed in terms of this one, so you may
# not need to change them.  This defaults to /usr/local.
prefix=@prefix@

# Like `prefix', but used for architecture-specific files.
exec_prefix=@exec_prefix@

# Where to install Emacs and other binaries that people will want to
# run directly (like etags).
bindir=${exec_prefix}/bin

# Where to install architecture-independent data files.	 ${lispdir}
# and ${etcdir} are subdirectories of this.
datadir=${prefix}/lib

# Where to install and expect the files that Emacs modifies as it
# runs.	 These files are all architecture-independent. Right now, the
# only such data is the locking directory; ${lockdir} is a
# subdirectory of this.
statedir=${prefix}/lib

# Where to install and expect executable files to be run by Emacs
# rather than directly by users, and other architecture-dependent
# data.	 ${archlibdir} is a subdirectory of this.
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib

# Where to install Emacs's man pages, and what extension they should have.
mandir=${prefix}/man/man1
manext=.1

# Where to install and expect the info files describing Emacs.	In the
# past, this defaulted to a subdirectory of ${prefix}/lib/emacs, but
# since there are now many packages documented with the texinfo
# system, it is inappropriate to imply that it is part of Emacs.
infodir=${prefix}/info

# Where to find the source code.  The source code for Emacs's C kernel is
# expected to be in ${srcdir}/src, and the source code for Emacs's
# utility programs is expected to be in ${srcdir}/lib-src.  This is
# set by the configure script's `--srcdir' option.
srcdir=@srcdir@

# ==================== Emacs-specific directories ====================

# These variables hold the values Emacs will actually use.  They are
# based on the values of the standard Make variables above.

@inst_paths@# Where to install the lisp files distributed with
@inst_paths@# Emacs.  This includes the Emacs version, so that the
@inst_paths@# lisp files for different versions of Emacs will install
@inst_paths@# themselves in separate directories.
@inst_paths@lispdir=${datadir}/emacs/${version}/lisp

@inst_paths@# Where to install the lisp files which are distributed
@inst_paths@# with Emacs but not maintained by the FSF.  This
@inst_paths@# includes the Emacs version, so that the lisp files for
@inst_paths@# different versions of Emacs will install themselves in
@inst_paths@# separate directories.
@inst_paths@externallispdir=${datadir}/emacs/${version}/external-lisp

@inst_paths@# Directories Emacs should search for lisp files specific
@inst_paths@# to this site (i.e. customizations), before consulting
@inst_paths@# ${lispdir}.  This should be a colon-separated list of
@inst_paths@# directories.
@inst_paths@locallisppath=${datadir}/emacs/site-lisp

# Where Emacs will search to find its lisp files.  Before
# changing this, check to see if your purpose wouldn't
# better be served by changing locallisppath.  This
# should be a colon-separated list of directories.
lisppath=${locallisppath}:${lispdir}

# Where Emacs will search for its lisp files while
# building.  This is only used during the process of
# compiling Emacs, to help Emacs find its lisp files
# before they've been installed in their final location.
# It's usually identical to lisppath, except that the
# entry for the directory containing the installed lisp
# files has been replaced with ../lisp.  This should be a
# colon-separated list of directories.
buildlisppath=${srcdir}/lisp

@inst_paths@# Where to install the other architecture-independent
@inst_paths@# data files distributed with Emacs (like the tutorial,
@inst_paths@# the cookie recipes and the Zippy database). This path
@inst_paths@# usually contains the Emacs version number, so the data
@inst_paths@# files for multiple versions of Emacs may be installed
@inst_paths@# at once.
@inst_paths@etcdir=${datadir}/emacs/${version}/etc

@inst_paths@# Where to create and expect the locking directory, where
@inst_paths@# the Emacs locking code keeps track of which files are
@inst_paths@# currently being edited.
@inst_paths@lockdir=${statedir}/emacs/lock

@inst_paths@# Where to put executables to be run by Emacs rather than
@inst_paths@# the user.  This path usually includes the Emacs version
@inst_paths@# and configuration name, so that multiple configurations
@inst_paths@# for multiple versions of Emacs may be installed at
@inst_paths@# once.
@inst_paths@archlibdir=${libdir}/emacs/${version}/${configuration}

# ====================== Developer's configuration =======================

# The following assignments make sense if you're running Emacs on a single
# machine, one version at a time, and  you want changes to the lisp and etc
# directories in the source tree to show up immediately in your working
# environment.  It saves a great deal of disk space by not duplicating the
# lisp and etc directories.

# ==================== Installation ====================

## If we let lib-src do its own installation, that means we
## don't have to duplicate the list of utilities to install in
## this Makefile as well.

## On AIX, use tar xBf.
## On Xenix, use tar xpf.

## We delete each directory in ${COPYDESTS} before we copy into it;
## that way, we can reinstall over directories that have been put in
## place with their files read-only (perhaps because they are checked
## into RCS).  In order to make this safe, we make sure that the
## source exists and is distinct from the destination.

# ==================== Cleaning up and miscellanea ====================

### `clean'
###	 Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
###	 created by building the program.  Don't delete the files that
###	 record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
###	 by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
###	 with them.
### `mostlyclean'
###	 Like `clean', but may refrain from deleting a few files that
###	 people normally don't want to recompile.  For example, the
###	 `mostlyclean' target for GCC does not delete `libgcc.a', because
###	 recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
### 
clean mostlyclean:
	cd src; $(MAKE) clean
	cd lib-src; $(MAKE) clean
	cd oldXMenu; $(MAKE) clean
	if [ `(cd ${etcdir} ; /bin/pwd)` != `(cd etc; /bin/pwd)` ] ; then \
	  cd etc; $(MAKE) clean; \
	else true; \
	fi

### `distclean'
###	 Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
###	 configuring or building the program.  This should leave only the
###	 files that would be in the distribution.
distclean:
	for i in ${SUBDIR}; do (cd $$i; $(MAKE) ${MFLAGS} distclean); done
	-(cd lock; rm *)
	-rm config.status config-tmp-*

### `realclean'
###	 Delete everything from the current directory that can be
###	 reconstructed with this makefile.  This typically includes
###	 everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files
###	 produced by Bison, tags tables, info files, and so on.
realclean:
	for i in ${SUBDIR}; do (cd $$i; $(MAKE) ${MFLAGS} realclean); done
	(cd lock; rm *)
	rm config.status

### This doesn't actually appear in the coding standards, but Karl
### says GCC supports it, and that's where the configuration part of
### the coding standards seem to come from.  It's like distclean, but
### it deletes backup and autosave files too.
extraclean:
	for i in ${SUBDIR}; do (cd $$i; $(MAKE) ${MFLAGS} extraclean); done
	-(cd lock; rm *)
	-rm config.status config-tmp-*

### Unlocking and relocking.  The idea of these productions is to reduce
### hassles when installing an incremental tar of Emacs.  Do `make unlock'
### before unlocking the file to take the write locks off all sources so
### that tar xvof will overwrite them without fuss.  Then do `make relock'
### afterward so that VC mode will know which files should be checked in
### if you want to mung them.
###
### Note: it's no disaster if these productions miss a file or two; tar
### and VC will swiftly let you know if this happens, and it is easily
### corrected.
