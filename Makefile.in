### Commentary:

# make all	to compile and build Emacs.
# make install	to install it.
# make TAGS	to update tags tables.
#
# make clean  or  make mostlyclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete '.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
#
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      'make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
#
# make maintainer-clean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean, plus more: .elc files,
#      C source files produced by Bison, tags tables, info files,
#      and so on.
#
# make extraclean
#      Still more severe - delete backup and autosave files, too.
#      Also generated files that do not normally change and can be slow
#      to rebuild (eg leim/ja-dic).
#
# make bootstrap
#      Removes all the compiled files to force a new bootstrap from a
#      clean slate, and then build in the normal way.
#
# make docs
#      Make Emacs documentation files from their sources; requires makeinfo.
#
# make check  or  make check-expensive
#      Run Emacs test suite.  check-expensive runs also tests which
#      take more time to perform.

## We delete each directory in ${COPYDESTS} before we copy into it;
## that way, we can reinstall over directories that have been put in
## place with their files read-only (perhaps because they are checked
## into RCS).  In order to make this safe, we make sure that the
## source exists and is distinct from the destination.

## We delete etc/DOC* because there may be irrelevant DOC files from
## other builds in the source directory.  This is ok because we just
## deleted the entire installed etc/ directory and recreated it.
## install-etcdoc installs the relevant DOC.

## Note that we install etc/refcards/*.ps if present.
## TODO we should compress these if GZIP_PROG is set.
## It would be simpler to have a separate install rule for etc/refcards
## (maybe move it to doc/refcards?).

## Note that the Makefiles in the etc directory are potentially useful
## in an installed Emacs, so should not be excluded.

## We always create the _default_ locallisppath directories, and
## ensure that they contain a subdirs.el file (via write_subdir).
## This is true even if locallisppath has a non-default value.
## In case of non-default value, we used to create the specified directories,
## but not add subdirs.el to them.  This was a strange halfway house.
## Nowadays we do not create non-default directories.

## Note that we use tar instead of plain old cp -R/-r because the latter
## is apparently not portable (even in 2012!).
## http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-05/msg00278.html
## I have no idea which platforms Emacs supports where cp -R does not
## work correctly, and therefore no idea when tar can be replaced.
