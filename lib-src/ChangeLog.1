2015-03-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port etags to -DDEBUG
	* etags.c (xnew, xrnew) [DEBUG]: Don't include chkmalloc.h, which
	is not part of Emacs and is typically not installed.
	Instead, just invoke xmalloc and xrealloc as usual.
	Problem reported by Nicolas Richard in:
	https://bugs.gnu.org/20191#20
	(xrnew): Avoid no-longer-needed cast to 'char *'.
	(xrealloc): First arg is now void *, not char *.

2015-03-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Random minor fixes for movemail
	* movemail.c: Include <stdbool.h> and <signal.h>.
	(waitpid) [WINDOWSNT]: New macro.
	(wait) [WINDOWSNT]: Remove.
	(main, popmail, pop_retr, mbx_write, mbx_delimit_begin)
	(mbx_delimit_end): Use bool for boolean.
	(main): Simplify #if usage a bit.
	(main): Don't assume EOF == -1.  Prefer 'return' to 'exit'.  Don't
	possibly unlink lockname twice, as that's a race condition.  Set
	SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL to work around SysV misfeature.  Check for fork
	failure.  Use waitpid, not wait, to avoid a race condition in the
	unlikely case where we start up with a child.
	(NOTOK, OK): Remove, in favor of plain boolean.
	(popmail, pop_retr): Don't get confused about errno, e.g., ferror
	need not set errno.
	(popmail): Use fclose (mbf), not close (fileno (mbf)), to also
	detect any stream-related errors (e.g., memory exhaustion).
	(pop_retr): Report pop errors separately, since caller now does
	errno reporting.
	(mbx_write, mbx_delimit_begin, mbx_delimit_end): Check < 0, not ==
	EOF, as it's a bit faster and (in theory) pickier.

2015-02-27  Mark Laws  <mdl@60hz.org>

	Support daemon mode on MS-Windows (bug#19688)
	* emacsclient.c (decode_options) [WINDOWSNT]: Don't reject empty
	arguments for --alternate-editor.
	(print_help_and_exit) [WINDOWSNT]: Don't refrain from advertising
	empty arguments for --alternate-editor.
	(start_daemon_and_retry_set_socket) [WINDOWSNT]: MS-Windows
	specific code to start Emacs in daemon mode and wait for it to be
	ready for client connections.

2015-02-23  Pete Williamson  <petewil0@googlemail.com>  (tiny change)

	Use ${EXEEXT} more uniformly in makefiles
	* Makefile.in (EMACS): Append ${EXEEXT}.

2015-02-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify binary I/O configuration
	* etags.c: Include <sysstdio.h> rather than <stdio.h>.
	(process_file_name, analyze_regex): Use FOPEN_BINARY rather than
	hard-coded "b".

2015-02-19  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* etags.c (process_file_name) [!DOS_NT]: Use "r", not "rb" in the
	call to 'popen'.  (Bug#19735)

2015-02-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Better support for future plugins
	See the thread containing:
	https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg00720.html
	* make-docfile.c (write_globals): Generate code that #defines
	Qxxx macros other than Qnil only if DEFINE_NONNIL_Q_SYMBOL_MACROS.
	Qnil is safe to define even in plugins, since it must be zero for
	other reasons.

2015-01-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a couple of AM_V_GEN bugs
	* Makefile.in (AM_V_GEN, am__v_GEN_, am__v_GEN_0, am__v_GEN_1)
	(AM_V_at, am__v_at_, am__v_at_0, am__v_at_1):
	New macros, copied from ../src/Makefile.in.

2015-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Check exit statuses in lib-src/Makefile
	* Makefile.in ($(DESTDIR)${archlibdir}, install, uninstall)
	(mostlyclean, clean, distclean, extraclean):
	Check exit statuses more carefully.  Reindent to fit in 80 chars.
	(bootstrap-clean maintainer-clean): Remove unnecessary 'true'.

2015-01-22  Ulrich Müller  <ulm@gentoo.org>

	* Makefile.in ($(DESTDIR)${archlibdir}): Don't fail if the chown
	or chgrp command is unsuccessful; the 'update-game-score' program
	has a fallback for this at runtime.

2015-01-21  Ulrich Müller  <ulm@gentoo.org>

	* update-game-score.c: Allow the program to run sgid instead
	of suid, in order to match common practice for most games.
	(main): Check if we are running sgid.  Pass appropriate file
	permission bits to 'write_scores'.
	(write_scores): New 'mode' argument, instead of hardcoding 0644.
	(get_prefix): Update error message.
	* Makefile.in (gamegroup): New variable, set by configure.
	($(DESTDIR)${archlibdir}): Handle both suid or sgid when
	installing the 'update-game-score' program.

2015-01-16  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (AM_V_RC, am__v_RC_, am__v_RC_0, am__v_RC_1): New
	macros.
	(emacsclient.res): Use $(AM_V_RC).

2015-01-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Give up on -Wsuggest-attribute=const
	* make-docfile.c (write_globals):
	Remove special hack for Fnext_read_file_uses_dialog_p

2015-01-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don't say Fnext_read_file_uses_dialog_p is const
	* make-docfile.c (write_globals):
	Add a special hack for Fnext_read_file_uses_dialog_p.

2015-01-13  Dmitry Antipov  <dmantipov@yandex.ru>

	Support DEFUN attributes.
	* make-docfile.c (struct global): New field 'flags'.
	(DEFUN_noreturn, DEFUN_const): New enum bitfields.
	(add_global): Now return pointer to global.
	(write_globals): Add _Noreturn and ATTRIBUTE_CONST attributes
	if requested by global's flags.
	(stream_match): New function.
	(scan_c_stream): Recognize 'attributes:' of DEFUN.

2015-01-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port to 32-bit --with-wide-int
	* make-docfile.c (write_globals): Define and use symbols like
	iQnil (a small integer, like 0) rather than aQnil (an address
	constant).

	Port to 32-bit Sun C 5.12 sparc
	* make-docfile.c (close_emacs_globals): Align lispsym to GCALIGNMENT.
	The alignment is required on all platforms; it just happens to have
	been properly aligned on the previous platforms we tested.

2015-01-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use 0 for Qnil
	* make-docfile.c (compare_globals): Consider 'nil' to be the least.

	Compute C decls for DEFSYMs automatically
	Fixes Bug#15880.
	* make-docfile.c: Revamp to generate table of symbols, too.
	Include <stdbool.h>.
	(xstrdup): New function.
	(main): Don't process the same file twice.
	(SYMBOL): New constant in enum global_type.
	(struct symbol): Turn 'value' member into a union, either v.value
	for int or v.svalue for string.  All uses changed.
	(add_global): New arg svalue, which overrides value, so that globals
	can have a string value.
	(close_emacs_global): New arg num_symbols; all uses changed.
	Output lispsym decl.
	(write_globals): Output symbol globals too.  Output more
	ATTRIBUTE_CONST, now that Qnil etc. are C constants.
	Output defsym_name table.
	(scan_c_file): Move most of guts into ...
	(scan_c_stream): ... new function.  Scan for DEFSYMs and
	record symbols found.  Don't read past EOF if file doesn't
	end in newline.

2015-01-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	'temacs -nw' should not call missing functions
	* make-docfile.c (write_globals):
	Declare Fframe_windows_min_size with ATTRIBUTE_CONST, too.  Sort.

	Less 'make' chatter for lib-src
	* Makefile.in (blessmail): Less 'make' chatter here.

2014-12-27  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (etags_libs, ebrowse${EXEEXT}, profile${EXEEXT})
	(make-docfile${EXEEXT}, movemail${EXEEXT})
	(update-game-score${EXEEXT}): Put $(NTLIB) before $(LOADLIBES),
	since GCC sometimes calls stpcpy when it sees strcpy, under
	optimization switches.

2014-12-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* ebrowse.c (sym_scope_1, operator_name, open_file):
	* emacsclient.c (get_server_config, set_local_socket)
	(start_daemon_and_retry_set_socket):
	* etags.c (main, C_entries, relative_filename):
	* pop.c (sendline):
	* update-game-score.c (main):
	Rewrite to avoid the need for strcat, typically by using stpcpy
	and/or lispstpcpy.  strcat tends to be part of O(N**2) algorithms.

2014-12-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* etags.c (analyze_regex): Rename from analyse_regex.

2014-12-14  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* grep-changelog: Remove file.
	* Makefile.in (INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS): Remove.
	(all, install, uninstall): Remove INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS.

2014-11-23  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (emacsclient.res): Fix yesterday's thinko.

2014-11-22  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (emacsclient.res): Update deps for nt/emacsclient.rc
	now being in the build directory, not the source directory.

	* Makefile.in (emacsclient.res): Add dependency on icons/emacs.ico.

2014-10-20  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Merge in all changes up to 24.4 release.

2014-09-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	movemail: don't dump core if the current time is outlandish
	* movemail.c (popmail): Check for mbx_delimit_begin failure.
	(mbx_delimit_begin): Fail if the current time is so outlandish
	that localtime would fail or asctime would have undefined
	behavior.  Use strftime to avoid asctime undefined behavior.

2014-09-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	--enable-silent-rules now suppresses more chatter.
	* Makefile.in (AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY, AM_V_CC, am__v_CC_)
	(am__v_CC_0, am__v_CC_1, AM_V_CCLD, am__v_CCLD_, am__v_CCLD_0)
	(am__v_CCLD_1): New macros, taken from Automake.
	(regex.o, etags${EXEEXT}, ctags${EXEEXT}, ebrowse${EXEEXT})
	(profile${EXEEXT}, make-docfile${EXEEXT}, movemail${EXEEXT})
	(pop.o, emacsclient${EXEEXT}, emacsclientw${EXEEXT})
	(emacsclientw${EXEEXT}, ntlib.o, hexl${EXEEXT})
	(update-game-score${EXEEXT}): Use them.

	* etags.c (emacs_strchr, emacs_strrchr): Remove.
	All uses replaced by strchr and strrchr, which are on all
	target platforms now.

2014-07-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use "b" flag more consistently; avoid "t" (Bug#18006).
	* make-docfile.c (READ_TEXT): Remove; all uses replaced by "r".
	(READ_BINARY): Remove; all uses replaced by "rb".

2014-07-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use binary-io module, O_BINARY, and "b" flag (Bug#18006).
	* etags.c, hexl.c, make-docfile.c:
	Include binary-io.h instead of fcntl.h and/or io.h.
	(main): Use set_binary_mode or SET_BINARY
	in place of handcrafted code.
	* etags.c (main) [DOS_NT]:
	* movemail.c (main) [WINDOWSNT]:
	Don't mess with _fmode.
	* etags.c (main, process_file_name, analyse_regex):
	Use fopen/popen's "b" flag instead.
	* movemail.c (main, popmail): Use open/lk_open/mkostemp's O_BINARY
	instead.

2014-07-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* make-docfile.c: Simplify a bit, to simplify further refactoring.
	(outfile): Remove static var.  All uses changed to use stdout,
	since it's always stdout anyway.  While we're at it, prefer
	putchar/puts/fputs to printf when there are no format strings.
	(main): Use freopen rather than fopen, so that stdout is reused.
	Move O_BINARY stuff after the freopen, so it affects the
	reopened file.
	(write_c_args): Omit first arg, since it's always stdout now.
	All uses changed.

2014-07-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* etags.c (Lisp_functions): Also record cl-defun etc. (Bug#17965)

2014-06-26  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (blessmail): Depend on lisp/mail/blessmail.el.
	Use $<, $@.
	(regex.o, etags${EXEEXT}, ctags${EXEEXT}, ebrowse${EXEEXT})
	(profile${EXEEXT}, make-docfile${EXEEXT}, movemail${EXEEXT})
	(pop.o, emacsclient${EXEEXT}, emacsclientw${EXEEXT}, ntlib.o)
	(hexl${EXEEXT}, update-game-score${EXEEXT}, emacsclient.res): Use $<.
	(ctags${EXEEXT}): Add $srcdir to dependency rather than using VPATH.

2014-06-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Omit redundant extern decls.
	* emacsclient.c (getenv): Remove decl.
	* make-docfile.c (write_globals): Add ATTRIBUTE_CONST for
	Fbyteorder, Ftool_bar_height, Fmax_char, Fidentity.

2014-06-15  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Explicitly set via configure.

2014-06-15  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (CPPFLAGS): Define.

2014-06-15  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (../lib/libgnu.a):
	Use `make -C' rather than `cd && make'.

	* Makefile.in (bootstrap-clean): New.

2014-06-13  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (../lib/libgnu.a):
	GNU make automatically passes command-line arguments to sub-makes.

2014-05-26  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* ntlib.h (lseek): Don't redirect to _lseek.

2014-05-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix rcs2log problems with CVS.  Reported by Glenn Morris in
	<https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2014-05/msg00277.html>.
	Plus, fix some security and filename quoting problems.
	* rcs2log (logdir): Prefer mktemp if available.
	(logdir, llogdir): Work even if TMPDIR begins with '-' or has spaces.
	(output_authors, main awk script): Parse more-recent CVS output format.

2014-05-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove dependencies on getline and getdelim.
	Also, remove update-game-scores's limits on game scores and
	simplify its file-locking code.
	* update-game-score.c (struct score_entry): Unify the username and
	data members to a single user_data member, since they don't need to be
	changed independently and getdelim and getline aren't helpful.
	Make the score member char *, not intmax_t, so that scores are not
	limited to intmax_t.  All uses changed.
	(lose_syserr): A zero errno stands for invalid data in score file.
	(normalize_integer): New function.
	(main): Use it.  Check for invalid scores.  Omit redundant stat check.
	(read_score): First arg is now a string, not a FILE *.  All uses
	changed.  Do not use getdelim or getline; that's way simpler.
	(read_scores): Read the whole file, and let read_score handle each
	line.
	(score_compare): Compare strings representing integers, not integers.
	(write_scores) [DOS_NT]: Eliminate unnecessary chmod.
	(lock_file): Simplify locking code, eliminating goto.
	Check for unlink failure.

2014-05-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port ctags+etags build to Sun C 5.12.
	* Makefile.in (etags_args): Remove, replacing with ...
	(etags_cflags, etags_libs): New macros.  All uses changed.
	(ctags${EXEEXT}): Don't compile etags.c, as compiling etags.c in
	parallel (once for ctags, once for etags) breaks parallel makes
	with compilers that use the source file name to name temporaries,
	such as Sun C 5.12.  Instead, compile ctags.c.
	* ctags.c: New file.

2014-05-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Handle systems without WCONTINUED consistently.  (Bug#15110, 17339)
	* emacsclient.c (WCONTINUED): Move to ../src/syswait.h.

2014-04-30  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in ($(DESTDIR)${archlibdir}):
	Avoid non-portable "`\" nesting.  (Bug#17339)

2014-04-16  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* update-game-score.c (write_scores): Condition fchmod call on
	DOS_NT, not WINDOWSNT.

2014-03-22  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (etags_deps, etags_args): New, to reduce duplication.
	(etags${EXEEXT}, ctags${EXEEXT}): Use etags_deps, etags_args.

	* Makefile.in (etags${EXEEXT}, ebrowse${EXEEXT}, ctags${EXEEXT})
	(profile${EXEEXT}, make-docfile${EXEEXT}, movemail${EXEEXT})
	(emacsclient${EXEEXT}, emacsclientw${EXEEXT}, hexl${EXEEXT})
	(update-game-score${EXEEXT}, emacsclient.res): Use $@.

	* Makefile.in (../lib/libgnu.a): Explicitly pass MFLAGS.

	* Makefile.in (DONT_INSTALL): Remove test-distrib.
	(test-distrib${EXEEXT}): Remove rule.

	* test-distrib.c, testfile: Remove.

2014-03-10  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* emacsclient.c (main): #ifdef out previous change on Windows.

2014-03-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix emacsclient terminal corruption when in background (Bug#16892).
	* emacsclient.c (handle_sigcont): Check for tcgetpgrp failure.
	Cancel the continue only if tty.  Send SIGTTIN to the process
	group, not SIGSTOP to self, as this is what the glibc manual
	recommends.
	(main): If tty, and if started in the background, send SIGTTIN
	to the process group.

2014-02-25  Andreas Amann  <a.amann@ucc.ie>  (tiny change)

	Fix emacsclient's handling of SIGCONT (Bug#16883).
	* emacsclient.c (handle_sigcont): Cancel the continue only if tty.

2014-01-22  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* update-game-score.c (write_scores) [WINDOWSNT]: Use chmod
	instead of fchmod.

2014-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix miscellaneous update-game-score bugs.
	* update-game-score.c (difftime) [!HAVE_DIFFTIME]: Remove.
	(read_score) [HAVE_GETDELIM]: Don't access uninitialized storage,
	as that leads to undefined behavior, which is a bad thing
	particularly in a setuid program.
	(read_scores, write_scores): Check for fclose failure; on some
	systems, I/O errors are not reported by primitives like getc and
	putc, but instead are delayed until fclose, so fclose failures
	should be diagnosed like other read and write errors.
	(write_scores): Use fchmod, not chmod, to avoid a race.
	Otherwise, if the lock is broken by some other process,
	update-game-score might try to change the permission on someone
	else's file or on a nonexistent file, and incorrectly report an
	error when this fails.
	(lock_file): Fix test for out-of-date lock file; it was reversed.
	That is, it incorrectly broke locks when they were more than an
	hour into the future, instead of when they were more than an hour
	in the past.  Use ordinary subtraction rather than difftime; since
	we're already assuming POSIX we don't need to worry about the
	possibility of time_t being a magic cookie, and since timestamps
	are positive we don't need to worry about integer overflow when
	subtracting them.  Put two spaces, not just one, after a sentence
	end in a comment.

2014-01-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	update-game-score fixes for -m and integer overflow (Bug#16428)
	* update-game-score.c: Include inttypes.h, stdbool.h.
	(min): New macro, if not already defined.
	(MAX_SCORES, main): Limit the maximum number of scores only from
	limits imposed by the underlying platform, instead of the
	arbitrary value 200.
	(struct score_entry, main, read_score, write_score):
	Scores are now intmax_t, not long.
	(get_user_id): Reject user names containing spaces or newlines,
	as they would mess up the score file.
	Allow uids that don't fit in 'long'.
	Increase the size of the buffer, to avoid overrun in weird cases.
	(get_prefix, main): Use bool for boolean.
	(main): Rewrite expr to avoid possibility of signed integer
	overflow.  Don't allow newlines in data, as this would mess up
	the score file.  Check for memory allocation failure when adding
	the new score, or when unlockint the file.  Implement -m.
	(read_score): Check for integer overflow when reading a score.
	(read_score) [!HAVE_GETDELIM]: Check for integer overflow when
	data gets very long.  Check only for space to delimit names,
	since that's what's done in the HAVE_GETDELIM case.
	(read_scores): New parameter ALLOC.  Change counts to ptrdiff_t.
	All uses changed.  Use push_score to add individual scores;
	that's simpler than repeating its contents.
	(score_compare_reverse): Simplify.
	(push_score): New parameter SIZE.  Change counts to ptrdiff_t.
	All uses changed.  Check for integer overflow of size calculation.
	(sort_scores, write_scores): Change counts to ptrdiff_t.
	(unlock_file): Preserve errno on success, so that storage
	exhaustion is diagnosed correctly.

2014-01-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Spelling fixes.
	* Makefile.in (regex.o): Remove reference to no-longer-used macros
	CONFIG_BROKETS and INHIBIT_STRING_HEADER.  "BROKETS" was a
	misspelling anyway....

2013-12-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use bool for boolean, focusing on headers.
	* emacsclient.c, etags.c, hexl.c (FALSE, TRUE):
	Remove.  All uses replaced with uncapitalized version.
	* emacsclient.c (message):
	* etags.c (make_tag, pfnote, consider_token, make_C_tag, lang_names):
	* hexl.c (un_flag, iso_flag, endian):
	* pop.c (pop_debug, pop_open, pop_multi_first, pop_multi_next)
	(pop_trash):
	Use bool for boolean.
	* etags.c (bool): Remove.
	* etags.c (globals, members, declarations, no_line_directive)
	(no_duplicates): Use 'int' for boolean values that getopt requires
	to be 'int'.  Formerly, these were 'bool' and 'bool' was 'int',
	but we can no longer rely on this implementation.
	* pop.h (struct _popserver): Use bool_bf for boolean bit-fields.

2013-11-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* ebrowse.c (xstrdup):
	* etags.c (savenstr): Prefer tail calls.
	* etags.c (concat): Omit unnecessary assignment.

2013-10-24  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in ($(DESTDIR)${archlibdir}):
	Avoid non-portable "`\" nesting.

	* Makefile.in (abs_top_srcdir): New, set by configure.

2013-10-23  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in ($(DESTDIR)${archlibdir}, need-blessmail, install)

2013-08-05  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	probing the stream for EOF.  Initialize score->score to zero,
	before reading and accumulating the score.
	(read_scores): Fix logic that determines which value to return.
	Close the input stream when finished reading the scores (avoids
	failures in overwriting the file with a new one on MS-Windows,

	* movemail.c (main): Call umask on all systems.
	This is OK since Emacs already assumes umask elsewhere.
	Don't grant more read permissions than necessary.
	The old 0333 dates back to before we called setuid,
	so it was needed back then to ensure user-readability,
	but 0377 should suffice now.

2013-02-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* movemail.c (getenv): Remove decl (unused since 1994).

2013-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* emacsclient.c (xmalloc): Accept size_t, not unsigned int, to
	avoid potential buffer overflow issues on typical 64-bit hosts.
	Return void *, not long *.
	(get_current_dir_name): Report a failure, instead of looping
	forever, if buffer size calculation overflows.  Treat malloc
	failures like realloc failures, as that has better behavior and is
	more consistent.  Do not check whether xmalloc returns NULL, as
	that's not possible.
	(message): Do not arbitrarily truncate message to 2048 bytes when
	sending it to stderr; use vfprintf instead.
	(get_server_config, set_local_socket)
	(start_daemon_and_retry_set_socket): Do not alloca
	arbitrarily-large buffers; that's not safe.
	(get_server_config, set_local_socket): Do not use sprintf when its
	result might not fit in 'int'.
	(set_local_socket): Do not assume uid fits in 'int'.

	* etags.c (xmalloc, xrealloc): Accept size_t, not unsigned int,
	to avoid potential buffer overflow issues on typical 64-bit hosts.
	(whatlen_max): New static var.
	(main): Avoid buffer overflow if subsidiary command length is
	greater than BUFSIZ or 2*BUFSIZ + 20.  Do not use sprintf when its
	result might not fit in 'int'.

	* movemail.c (main): Do not use sprintf when its result might not fit
	in 'int'.  Instead, put the possibly-long file name into the
	output of pfatal_with_name.

	* update-game-score.c: Include <limits.h>
	(get_user_id): Do not assume uid fits in 'int'.  Simplify.

	* movemail.c, pop.c: Include string.h unconditionally.
	* update-game-score.c: No need to include stdarg.h; not used.

	Assume support for memcmp, memcpy, memmove, memset.

	* movemail.c: Fix race condition and related bugs (Bug#8836).
	(main) [!MAIL_USE_SYSTEM_LOCK]: Prefer mkstemp to mktemp, as this
	fixes some race conditions.  Report mkstemp/mktemp errno rather
	than a possibly-garbage errno.  Reinitialize the template each
	time through the loop, as earlier mkstemp/mktemp calls could have
	trashed it.  Pass 0600 (not 0666) to mktemp, for consistency
	with mkstemp; the permissions don't matter anyway.

2011-06-01  Dan Nicolaescu  <dann@ics.uci.edu>

	* emacsclient.c (socket_status): Use constant pointer.

	This avoids a warning with gcc -Wstrict-overflow, and works
	better for very large objects.
	(inbuffer_size): Now size_t.  All uses changed.
	(xmalloc, xrealloc, operator_name, process_file): Use size_t for
	sizes.  Don't bother testing whether a size_t value can be negative.

	* etags.c (Ada_funcs): Redo slightly to avoid overflow warning.

	etags: In Prolog functions, don't assume int fits in size_t.
	This avoids a warning with gcc -Wstrict-overflow.
	* etags.c (Prolog_functions, prolog_pr, prolog_atom): Use size_t,
	not int, to store sizes.
	(prolog_atom): Return 0, not -1, on error.  All callers changed.

	update-game-score: fix bug with -r
	* update-game-score.c (main): Don't set 'scores' to garbage when
	-r is specified and scorecount != MAX_SCORES (Bug#8310).  This bug
	was introduced in the 2002-04-10 change, and was found with gcc
	-Wstrict-overflow (GCC 4.5.2, x86-64).

	(w32_getenv): Use xstrdup to return all values in malloc'ed
	storage.

2011-02-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* ebrowse.c (parse_qualified_param_ident_or_type): Make it clear
	to reader (and to the compiler) that the loop always executes at
	least once.  This prevents a warning with recent GCC.
	(BROWSE_STRUCT): Remove unused macro.

	* fakemail.c: Include <ignore-value.h>.
	(put_line): Explicitly ignore fwrite return value, for benefit of
	recent glibc + gcc.

	exiting with nonzero status.
	(my_fclose, main): Diagnose input errors, and exit with nonzero status.
	Formerly, input errors were silently ignored.

	All callers changed.  This is cleaner, and avoids GCC warnings about
	passing NULL to fputs.
	(insert_keyword): Rename parameter to avoid shadowing diagnostic.

	to avoid a GCC "assignment discards qualifiers" diagnostic
	in some configurations.
	(scan_c_file): Refactor local variable decls to make their scope
	more accurate and to avoid a GCC -Wuninitialized diagnostic.

2011-02-22  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* pop.c (min): Likewise.
	* Makefile.in (ebrowse${EXEEXT}, pop.o): Depend on min-max.h.

	* movemail.c (popmail): Report fchown failure instead of ignoring it.

	* etags.c (gperf, in_word_set): Change attribute for Java to
	(C_JAVA & ~C_PLPL).  The previous change introduced 2004-09-13 was

	wrong with Cpp and Lex.
	(Makefile_targets): Do not include spaces in tag names.

2002-06-20  Francesco Potortì  <pot@gnu.org>

2002-04-13  Francesco Potortì  <pot@gnu.org>

	* etags.c (find_entries): Delete tags previously obtained from
	file xxx.c's #line directives when parsing file xxx.y.  This is

	be discarded.
	(language): Add the metasource member.  Initializers changed.
	(invalidate_nodes): New function.
	(readline): Discard lines after having found a #line
	directive pointing to an already tagged file.  This handles the

	(readline): Use fdhead and curfdp.
	(process_file, find_entries): Do not take an arg string, all
	callers changed.

	* etags.c (longopts, print_help, main): Test CTAGS to disallow
	options that are not right for either etags or ctags.

	* etags.c (number_len, total_size_of_entries): Define them also
	in CTAGS mode, because gcc does not compile all refs away.

	* update-game-score.c (lock_file): If the lock file is older than
	an hour, delete it.  Reset attempts to zero if we have to break

	* pop.c (socket_connection):
	gethostbyname may return a pointer to static data.

	option', since CVS says 'invalid option'.

1993-05-28  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c: Replace the CPP tangle for alloca with the one from the
	autoconf documentation, since that's working elsewhere.

1993-05-27  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Add "-I.", so the system and machine
	description files can find their ancestors.

1993-05-27  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install): Get the scripts from ${srcdir},

1993-05-27  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 19.9 released.

1993-05-26  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install): Do install the programs listed in
	INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS.  Make the renaming loop use INSTALLABLES and
	INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS, instead of writing the programs out.

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Include -I${srcdir}.
	(getopt.o, getopt1.c): Use ${srcdir} as appropriate.

1993-05-25  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c: Include ../src/config.h.

	* Makefile.in (timer.o, sorted-doc.c): Link with alloca.o, if it's
	appropriate.

	* Makefile.in (install): Refer to the variables INSTALLABLES and
	INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS, instead of writing them out.

1993-05-23  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

1993-05-22  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 19.7 released.

1993-05-22  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (scan_lisp_file): Recognize defalias like fset.

1993-05-19  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* tcp.c: New file.

1993-05-18  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (.c.o): Make the rule start with a tab, not spaces.

1993-05-15  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* timer.c (notify): Don't call sighold or sigrelse; they're USG
	only.  We should really fix this later, but let's just make it
	compile for now.

	Install patches from David J. Mackenzie to make the srcdir option
	work.
	* Makefile.in (srcdir, VPATH): Get this value from the top-level
	Makefile.
	(INSTALLABLES): Split this into two lists - INSTALLABLES and
	INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS.
	(INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS): New list.
	(EXECUTABLES): Include INSTALLABLE_SCRIPTS.
	(${archlibdir}): The scripts to be installed live in the source
	tree, not in the object tree.

	not the object tree.
	(GETOPTDEPS): Note that getopt.h lives in the source tree.
	(all other targets): Change references to source files to use
	${srcdir}, except for config.h, which lives in the object dir.
	(timer.o): Note that this depends on ../src/config.h.
	* make-docfile.c (main): Add a -d option, to tell it where to find
	the source files.
	* test-distrib.c (main): Take the name of the distribution file to
	test from the command line.

	* timer.c: Fix misspellings of get_date function's name.

1993-05-12  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (main):
	Don't require that there be input files if -i switches were given.

1993-05-09  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	The GNU coding standards specify that CFLAGS should be left for
	users to set.
	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Put this in the "things configure might
	edit" section, and have it default to -g.
	(ALL_CFLAGS): New variable, set to all the flags which should be
	passed to compilations.  Replace all other uses of CFLAGS with
	ALL_CFLAGS.
	(.c.o): New rule, to pass ALL_CFLAGS to compilations.

	* Makefile.in (DEFS): Remove this; it's always just going to be
	"-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Demacs".

1993-05-03  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* rcs2log: mawk, SunOS 4.1.3 nawk, and Ultrix/MKS nawk all barf on
	/[/]/, so change it to /[\/]/.  This should work on all
	POSIX-compliant awks.  It's slightly wrong with traditional awk,
	since it matches \ too, but that's a minor problem compared to awk
	syntax errors.

1993-05-01  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (ALLOCA): New variable, whose value we should
	inherit from the top-level makefile.
	(etags, ctags): Include ALLOCA in the list of object files that
	these executables depend on and link.

1993-04-09  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (DEFS): Rename from CONFIG_CFLAGS.

1993-04-07  Jim Blandy  (jimb@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Print an argument named "defalt"
	as "default".

1993-03-24  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	(CFLAGS): Include C_SWITCH_SYSTEM in the flags to pass to the
	compiler.

1993-03-22  Francesco Potortì  (pot@cnuce.cnr.it)

	* etags.c (YACC): Flag added to c_ext.
	(c_ext): No more a synonim for c_ext&C_PLPL because of YACC.
	(find_entries): Consistently use streq when reasonable.
	(find_entries): A .y file is a yacc file.
	(get_C_stab): c_ext becomes c_ext&C_PLPL.
	(C_entries): Logical cplpl means c_ext&C_PLPL.
	(C_entries): Logical yacc_rules means we are after the first %%.
	(C_entries): Add logic for yacc files.

1993-03-16  Francesco Potortì  (pot@cnuce.cnr.it)

	* etags.c (C_entries): ':' case moved to the second switch.

	(consider_token): structtag set to null string for enum.

1993-03-12  Francesco Potortì  (pot@cnuce.cnr.it)

	* etags.c (GET_COOKIE): And related macros removed.
	(logical): Is now int, no more a char.
	(reg): Define deleted.
	(isgood, _gd, notgd): Delete.
	(gotone): Delete.
	(TOKEN): Member linestart removed.
	(linepos, prev_linepos, lb1): Delete.
	(main): Call initbuffer on lbs array instead of lb1.
	(init): Remove the initialization of the logical _gd array.
	(find_entries): A .sa suffix means assembler file.

	All C state machines rewritten.
	(C_entries): Complete rewrite.
	(condider_token): Complete rewrite.
	(getline): Delete.

1993-03-01  Francesco Potortì  (pot@fly.CNUCE.CNR.IT)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Add the quotednl logical variable.
	Used for parsing of #define's spanning multiple lines.

1993-02-23  Francesco Potortì  (pot@fly.CNUCE.CNR.IT)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Save the definedef status even when a
	newline is met inside a string.

1993-03-19  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (EXECUTABLES): Add rcs-checkin.

	* Makefile.in (unlock, relock): New productions.

1993-03-16  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* rcs2log: Some awks don't understand "\r".  Code around this.
	Unfortunately this requires putting a carriage return in the
	source code.  Don't assume that rlog will tolerate times like
	`10:10:60'; RCS 5.7 won't allow this.

1993-03-10  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (main): Set the ownership of the stdin file descriptor
	to the current process.  Print error messages if either of the
	fcntl's fails.

	* timer.c (sigcatch): Declare this to return SIGTYPE (defined in
	../src/config.h), not void.

1993-03-06  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

1993-03-01  Francesco Potortì  (pot@fly.CNUCE.CNR.IT)

	* etags.c (C_entries): New local variable quotednl.  Used for
	parsing of #define's spanning multiple lines.

	* etags.c (C_entries): Save the definedef status
	even when a newline is met inside a string.

1993-02-26  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (notify): Initialize waitfor properly.

1993-02-22  Francesco Potortì  (pot@CNUCE.CNR.IT)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Don't reset definedef when a newline inside a
	comment is met.

1993-01-14  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (find_entries): If filename ends in .f or .for,
	don't try anything but Fortran.

1993-01-08  Michael I Bushnell  (mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* timer.c (notify): Flush stdout after writing message to avoid lossage
	on terminals.

	(notify): Also, write a newline after the token.

1992-12-12  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (exec_prefix): New variable.
	(bindir, libdir): Use it instead of `prefix'.

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): #define HAVE_CONFIG_H, too.

	* Makefile.in (libdir): Default to ${prefix}/lib.
	(archlibdir): Adjust to match.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't delete backup or autosave files.
	(extraclean): Like realclean, but does delete backup and autosave
	files.

	* Makefile.in (realclean): Ignore errors from rm.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't bother to delete ../arch-lib;
	that doesn't exist anymore.

1992-12-11  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (prefix, bindir, libdir, srcdir): New variables, as
	described in the top-level Makefile.
	(UTILITIES): Add make-path to the list of utility programs.
	(../arch-lib): Replace by the ${archlibdir} target, which places
	the executables in their permanent home.
	(install, install.sysv, install.xenix): Consolidated into one
	target which should work under all circumstances, modulo a few
	ignored error messages.

	* make-docfile.c (scan_c_file): Since DEFVAR_PER_BUFFER now takes
	a different number of arguments than other DEFVARs, recognize it
	specially, and expect the right number of commas.

1992-12-04  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-path.c: New program, to help with the installation process.
	* Makefile.in (make-path): New target.

	* make-path.c (touchy_mkdir): Remove debugging output.

1992-11-05  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (getdate.o): Add explicit target for this, so we
	can indicate that it depends on ../src/config.h.

1992-11-04  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (CONFIG_CFLAGS): Let the configure script edit this
	instead of CFLAGS.
	(CFLAGS): Add -Demacs and -I../src to CONFIG_CFLAGS to produce this.

1992-09-30  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* getdate.y: Correctly recognize Mt. Xinu BSD running on an HP
	9000/300 as BSD; don't include both <sys/time.h> and <time.h> on
	that system.

	* Makefile.in (arch-lib): Give rm the `-f' option.

1992-09-28  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Rewritten to correctly print
	&optionals before the first identifier, but after the first paren.
	This code used to just wait for commas or spaces; now it notices
	identifier boundaries.

1992-09-26  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* rcs2log: When getting date, use %02d instead of %.2d in awk printf.

1992-09-23  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Print the argument lists properly
	when the first argument is optional.

1992-09-19  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sorted-doc.c (main): Redefine special chars to use fonts tensy, teni.
	Redefine @item.  Set catcode of +.

1992-08-22  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* emacsclient.c (main): Set IPC_CREAT in msgget call.

1992-08-20  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (TEX_funcs): Keep just 1 of two redundant nested loops.
	(TEX_decode_env): Make `tab' one element longer.

1992-08-20  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (PF_funcs): Recognize the "entry" keyword.

1992-08-18  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Add rcs2log and vcdiff to the list of utilities.

1992-08-14  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (events): Rather than having slots marked as in use or
	out of use by the `token' field, keep all pending events at the
	beginning of the array.  When we delete an event in the middle of
	the array, we move the last event into its place.
	(num_events): New variable.
	(schedule): It is now cheaper to find a free event slot;
	events[num_events] is the first free slot.
	(notify): Scan events[0 .. num_events-1], instead of the whole
	array.  When an event fires, move the last event in the array into
	its spot.  Use num_events to determine whether or not there are
	any pending events, not wait_for.
	(getevent): Delete unused variable `ep'.
	(sigcatch): It's now easier to find all the active events.
	(main): Initialize num_events.

	* etags.c: Rather than fret about which systems have index and
	which systems have strchr, and how to tell the difference between
	them, we just write out our own versions.  Big deal.
	(index, rindex): Extern declarations removed.
	(NEED_INDEX, NEED_RINDEX): Special hacks for hpux removed.
	(etags_index, etags_rindex): New declarations.
	(process_file, find_entries, pfnote, TEX_funcs, TEX_decode_env,
	TEX_getit, substr): Use the etags_*index functions, rather than
	the native *index functions.
	(rindex, index): Rename to etags_rindex and tags_rindex, and
	made them unconditionally defined, rather than having them depend
	on NEED_*INDEX.

	* etags.c (savenstr): Add declaration for this at top of file.
	(TEX_decode_env): Don't declare it local to this function.

	* b2m.c: #include "../src/config.h", so we can test for the USG
	macro, and decide whether to include <string.h> or <strings.h>.
	* Makefile.in: Note that b2m.c depends on ../src/config.h.

1992-08-13  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c: Reformatted according to the GNU coding standards.
	Removed arbitrary limits on the number of events queued and the
	length of the tokens used to identify them.
	Removed casts to (void).
	Removed debugging printfs; they clutter the code, and the need
	can be better filled using a real debugger.

1992-08-07  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c: Installed new version from Eric Raymond; this is more
	portable, since it doesn't try to use SIGIO.

1992-07-17  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* emacsclient.c (main): If we can't find the socket in this
	person's home directory, print a message which asks if they've
	started the server, instead of just printing the message from
	sys_errmsg; Cygnus finds that people are much less confused by
	this.

1992-07-14  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c: Rather than defining "notdef" when "hpux" is #defined,
	so that index and rindex get defined, why don't we actually
	control index and rindex using symbols called "NEED_INDEX" and
	"NEED_RINDEX", and define them if hpux is defined?  Isn't that a
	little more readable than defining something whose name implies
	that it's not?

1992-07-08  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* movemail.c: Merged changes from Jamie Zawinski's byte compiler
	distribution:
	Miscellaneous doc fixes.
	(skip_white, read_lisp_symbol): New functions.
	(scan_lisp_file): Instead of using long hairy strings of ifs, call
	read_lisp_symbol and then see what we got.  Call skip_white
	instead of writing out a loop to do its job.  Correctly extract
	docstrings from "defmacro" declarations.

1992-06-25  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* movemail.c (strcpy): Declare this to return char *.

1992-06-18  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): When we find a C++ comment, do actually
	skip to the end of the line; do a 'break' instead of a 'continue'.

1992-06-11  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (getit): Add missing parenthesis to expression which
	decides if this token is an identifier.

1992-06-04  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (consider_token): Recognize `ENTRY' macro used in libc.

1992-05-30  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (put_entries): Always put space between name and line num.

1992-05-28  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)

	* etags.c (getit): Parenthesize &&/|| expression to avoid gcc
	warning.
	(LEVEL_OK_FOR_FUNCDEF): Ditto.

1992-05-19  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Pass both arguments to putc.

1992-05-10  Roland McGrath  (roland@albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Fix reading of "..." strings.
	(consider_token): Recognize `SYSCALL' and `PSEUDO' macros, used in
	the C library source.

	* etags.c (C_entries): When we see a backslash inside a quoted
	string, skip to the next character.  This allows us to correctly
	deal with strings containing quotes.

1992-05-08  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Print the C argument names as
	they would be written in Elisp; print '_' as '-'.

1992-05-07  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* movemail.c [POP]: Get user name via getpwuid.

1992-05-04  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Flags in CC invocations rearranged for no reason.

1992-04-20  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (print_help): Remember not to embed raw newlines in
	strings - end the lines with `\n\'.

1992-04-17  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (getevent): Remove declaration of memcpy; since
	different systems have different return types, and we're not even
	using the return type anyway, it wasn't doing us any good.

1992-04-16  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* emacsserver.c (msgcatch): Use the SIGTYPE macro to declare the
	type of this function.

1992-04-08  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c: "--no-warning" option renamed to "--no-warn",
	to be consistent with other GNU programs, like makeinfo.

	* Makefile: Renamed to Makefile.in; the configure script
	will edit this to produce Makefile.

1992-04-08  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	New directory, with files previously in ../etc. [approximate date]
	* README: New file.
	* Makefile: Copy here from ../etc/Makefile.
	* aixcc.lex, b2m.c, cvtmail.c, digest-doc.c:
	* emacsclient.c, emacsserver.c, emacstool.c, env.c:
	* etags-vmslib.c, etags.c, fakemail.c, getdate.c, getdate.y:
	* getopt.c, getopt.h, getopt1.c, hexl.c, leditcfns.c:
	* make-docfile.c, movemail.c, qsort.c, sorted-doc.c:
	* test-distrib.c, testfile, timer.c, wakeup.c, yow.c:
	Move here from ../etc.
