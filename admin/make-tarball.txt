Instructions to create pretest or release tarballs. -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Steps to take before starting on the first pretest in any release sequence:

0.  The release branch (e.g. emacs-24) should already have been made
    and you should use it for all that follows.  Diffs from this
    branch should be going to the emacs-diffs mailing list.

1.  Decide on versions of automake and autoconf, and ensure you will
    have them available for the duration of the release process.

2.  Consider increasing the value of the variable
    `customize-changed-options-previous-release' in cus-edit.el to
    refer to a newer version of Emacs.  (This is probably needed only
    when preparing the first pretest for a major Emacs release.)
    Commit cus-edit.el if changed.

3.  Remove any old pretests from ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest.
    You can use `gnupload --delete' (see below for more gnupload details).

General steps (for each step, check for possible errors):

1.   git pull     # fetch from the repository
     git status   # check for locally modified files

2.  Regenerate the etc/AUTHORS file:
      M-: (require 'authors) RET
      M-x authors RET

    If there is an "*Authors Errors*" buffer, address the issues.
    If there was a ChangeLog typo, fix it.  If a file was deleted or
    renamed, consider adding an appropriate entry to authors-ignored-files,
    authors-valid-file-names, or authors-renamed-files-alist.

    If necessary, repeat M-x authors after making those changes.
    Save the "*Authors*" buffer as etc/AUTHORS.
    Check the diff looks reasonable.  Maybe add entries to
    authors-ambiguous-files or authors-aliases, and repeat.
    Commit any fixes to ChangeLogs or authors.el.

3.  Set the version number (M-x load-file RET admin/admin.el RET, then
    M-x set-version RET).  For a release, add released ChangeLog
    entries (M-x add-release-logs RET).

    For a pretest, start at version .90.  After .99, use .990 (so that
    it sorts).

    The final pretest should be a release candidate.  Set the version
    number to that of the actual release.  Pick a date about a week
    from now when you intend to make the release.  Use M-x add-release-logs
    to add the ChangeLog entries for that date to the tar file (but
    not yet to the repository).  Name the tar file as
    emacs-XX.Y-rc1.tar.  If all goes well in the following week, you
    can simply rename the file and use it for the actual release.

4.   autoreconf -i -I m4 --force
     make bootstrap

     make -C etc/refcards
     make -C etc/refcards clean

5.  Copy lisp/loaddefs.el to lisp/ldefs-boot.el.

    Commit etc/AUTHORS, lisp/ldefs-boot.el, and the files changed
    by M-x set-version. For a release, also commit the ChangeLog
    files in all directories.

    If someone else made a commit between step 1 and now,
    you need to repeat from step 4 onwards.  (You can commit the files
    from step 2 and 3 earlier to reduce the chance of this.)

6.  ./make-dist --snapshot --no-compress

    Check the contents of the new tar with admin/diff-tar-files
    against the previous release (if this is the first pretest) or the
    previous pretest.  If you did not make the previous pretest
    yourself, find it at <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest>.
    Releases are of course at <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/>.

    If this is the first pretest of a major release, just comparing
    with the previous release may overlook many new files.  You can try
    something like `find . | sort' in a clean repository, and compare the
    results against the new tar contents.

7.   tar -xf emacs-NEW.tar; cd emacs-NEW
     ./configure --prefix=/tmp/emacs && make && make install
    Use `script' or M-x compile to save the compilation log in
    compile-NEW.log and compare it against an old one.  The easiest way
    to do that is to visit the old log in Emacs, change the version
    number of the old Emacs to __, do the same with the new log and do
    M-x ediff.  Especially check that Info files aren't built, and that
    no autotools (autoconf etc) run.

8.  cd EMACS_ROOT_DIR && git tag -a TAG && git push origin tag TAG
    TAG is emacs-XX.Y.ZZ for a pretest, emacs-XX.Y for a release.

9. Decide what compression schemes to offer.
    For a release, at least gz and xz:
      gzip --best -c emacs-NEW.tar > emacs-NEW.tar.gz
      xz -c emacs-NEW.tar > emacs-NEW.tar.xz
    For pretests, just xz is probably fine (saves bandwidth).

    Now you should upload the files to the GNU ftp server.  In order to
    do that, you must be registered as an Emacs maintainer and have your
    GPG key acknowledged by the ftp people.  For instructions, see
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Automated-Upload-Registration.html
    The simplest method to upload is to use the gnulib
    <http://www.gnu.org/s/gnulib/> script "build-aux/gnupload":

    For a pretest:
     gnupload [--user your@gpg.key.email] --to alpha.gnu.org:emacs/pretest \
       FILE.gz FILE.xz ...

    For a release:
     gnupload [--user your@gpg.key.email] --to ftp.gnu.org:emacs \
       FILE.gz FILE.xz ...

    You only need the --user part if you have multiple GPG keys and do
    not want to use the default.
    Obviously, if you do not have a fast uplink, be prepared for the
    upload to take a while.


    If you prefer to do it yourself rather than use gnupload:

    For each FILE, create a detached GPG binary signature and a
    clearsigned directive file like this:

     gpg -b FILE
     echo directory: emacs/pretest > FILE.directive      (for a pretest)
     echo directory: emacs > FILE.directive              (for a release)
     gpg --clearsign FILE.directive
    Upload by anonymous ftp to ftp://ftp-upload.gnu.org/ the files FILE,
    FILE.sig, FILE.directive.asc.
    For a release, place the files in the /incoming/ftp directory.
    For a pretest, place the files in /incoming/alpha instead, so that
    they appear on ftp://alpha.gnu.org/.

10. After five minutes, verify that the files are visible at
    ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/ for a pretest, or
    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/ for a release.

    Download them and check the signatures.  Check they build.

11. Send an announcement to: emacs-devel, and bcc: info-gnu-emacs@gnu.org.
    For a pretest, also bcc: platform-testers@gnu.org.
    For a release, also bcc: info-gnu@gnu.org.
    (The reason for using bcc: is to make it less likely that people
    will followup on the wrong list.)
    See the info-gnu-emacs mailing list archives for the form
    of past announcements.  The first pretest announcement, and the
    release announcement, should have more detail.

12. For a release, update the Emacs homepage emacs.html in the web repository.
    Also update history.html, and add the new NEWS file as news/NEWS.xx.y.
    Regenerate the html manuals (use make-manuals from admin.el).
    If there are new manuals, add appropriate index pages.
    Delete any old manual pages that are no longer present.
