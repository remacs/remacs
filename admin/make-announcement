There is a new pretest available in

  <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/emacs-$NEW.tar.gz>
  <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/leim-$NEW.tar.gz>

Please report results from compiling and running the pretest to
<emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org>.  Your feedback is necessary for us
to know on which platforms the pretest has been tried.
Please say whether you built with LEIM or not.

If you have the tars from the previous pretest, and you have the
\`xdelta' utility, you can instead download the much smaller

  <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/emacs-$OLD-$NEW.xdelta>
  <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/leim-$OLD-$NEW.xdelta>

You can use a command like

  $ xdelta patch XDELTA PREVIOUS-TAR CURRENT-TAR

to generate the new tar from the old one, where XDELTA is the xdelta
file you downloaded, PREVIOUS-TAR is the tar file from the previous
pretest, and CURRENT-TAR is the name of the tar file you downloaded.

Information about xdelta can be found on the GNU ftp site, in
/non-gnu/xdelta.README.
