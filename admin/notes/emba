NOTES FOR EMACS CONTINUOUS BUILD ON EMBA

A continuous build for Emacs can be found at
<https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs>, a Gitlab instance.  It watches the
Emacs git repository and starts a pipeline (jobset) if there are new
changes.  This happens for all Emacs branches.

* Mail notifications

In addition to the web interface, emba can send notifications by email
when a job fails.  It sends notifications about test status to
<emacs-buildstatus@gnu.org>.

If you want to receive these notifications, please subscribe at
<https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-buildstatus>.

Alternatively, these notifications can be read via gmane at
<nntp+news.gmane.org:gmane.emacs.buildstatus>.

The messages contain a URL to the log file of the failed job, like
<https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs/-/jobs/739/raw>.

* Emacs jobset

The Emacs jobset is defined in the Emacs source tree, file
'.gitlab-ci.yml'.  It could be adapted for every Emacs branch, see
<https://emba.gnu.org/help/ci/yaml/README.md>.

Every job runs in a Debian docker container.  It uses the local clone
of the Emacs git repository to perform a bootstrap and test of Emacs.
This could happen for several jobs with changed configuration, compile
and test parameters.

* Emba configuration

The emba configuration files are hosted on
<https://gitlab.com/emacs-ci/emba-ansible>.

* Identifying emba

Lisp packages, Makefiles, scripts, and other software could determine
whether they run on emba by checking for the environment variable
EMACS_EMBA_CI.
