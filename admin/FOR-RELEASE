Tasks needed before the next release.

* UPDATE COPYRIGHTS (Happy New Year :-)
  Done, I think. Please keep an eye out for any errors, eg copyrights
  not at the start of the file that are easy to miss, as in
  src/emacs.c.

  See also the oustanding issues in admin/notes/copyright.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Check for widow and orphan lines in manuals;
make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

** Check for text in manuals that assumes current version is 21.

** Update AUTHORS.

** Regenerate the postscript files of the reference cards in etc.

** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

Requests to have been sent out on 2006-05-23 (Reiner Steib).

Reminders sent out on 2006-06-08.

Note: regardless of the above, the following files need to be
regenerated to get updated copyright notices: sk-refcard.ps,
pl-refcard.ps, cs-refcard.ps.

** Send an email to the various distributions, including the GNOME
and KDE projects, to use the new Emacs icons in etc/images/icons.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.
These don't need to be fixed to start pretest, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay  display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

** make-network-process :nowait t doesn't work for non-local targets
   on Windows.  This has been "fixed" for Emacs 22 by defining
   BROKEN_NON_BLOCKING_CONNECT in ms-w32.h.


* BUGS

** W3 status with latest url package.

** Fix up the notices in oldXMenu properly.

** disumu@x3y2z1.net, Nov 22:
  URL not following some 302 redirects after recent changes

** lennart.borgman.073@student.lu.se, Dec 29:
  How global is a define-global-minor-mode mode
He says that customizing such a mode simply does not work.
RMS says that there is no code in the generated defcustom,
or elsewhere in the generated code, to implement setting that variable
through the custom mechanism.

** simon.marshall@misys.com, Jan 12: 
  Font-lock decides function call is function declaration in C+ +

** ZTHJWSQQAFHV@spammotel.com, Jan 12:
  Color-theme problems in Emacs 22+ (Ubuntu, Windows)

** Binding print-circle to nil in compilation for certain files.

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
