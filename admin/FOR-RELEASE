Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

* BUGS WAITING FOR MORE USER INPUT

** undefined reference getopt_long
Report by Daniel C. Bastos <dbast0s@yahoo.com.br> on bug-gnu-emacs
from 2007-08-27.  Impossible to procede without more input from OP (as
of 20070912, emails are bouncing) or someone else who can reproduce this.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01497.html

** emacs-22.1 with GTK problems (with patches)
Only outstanding issue seems to be whether Solaris 2.6 GTK can be
supported in the absence of recursive mutexes, via a change to
alloc.c, or whether configure should abort.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00055.html

* BUGS

** python.el changes by Dave Love.

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
