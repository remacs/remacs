Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

Reminders sent out on 2006-06-08.

** Remove temporary +++/--- lines in NEWS.

** Try to reorder NEWS: most important things first, related items together.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

** eliz@gnu.org, May 20: EOL conversion of files in .tar archives

* BUGS

NB the definitive copy of this file for Emacs 22 is on the
EMACS_22_BASE branch.  Any entries below are automatically copied from
that branch.  Do not make manual changes to this file on the trunk.

** michael.ewe@arcor.de, Apr 24: 22.0.98  not starting on Solaris 10/I386
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-04/msg01113.html

* FIXES FOR EMACS 22.2

Here we list small fixes that arrived too late for Emacs 22.1, but
that should be installed on the release branch after 22.1 is released.

** Changes to six pbm icons in etc/images.
Sync change from trunk 2007-05-19.

** viper and tramp should not load cl at run time.

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
