Tasks needed before the next release.

* NEW FEATURES

** Test the mbox branch of Rmail.

** Install the mbox branch of Rmail.

** Face remapping.

** Let mouse-1 follow links.


* FATAL ERRORS

** Investigate face cache related crash.

Indications: Face cache seems to have been cleared, but
redisplay uses an invalidated face_id with FACE_FROM_ID
which then returns a NULL pointer.  Said to happen with
isearch faces.

** Investigate reported crashes in compact_small_strings.

** Investigate reported crashes related to using an
invalid pointer from string_free_list.


* LOSSAGE

** Clean up flymake.el to follow Emacs Lisp conventions.


* GTK RELATED BUGS

** Make GTK scrollbars behave like others w.r.t. overscrolling.


* REDISPLAY RELATED BUGS

** Avoid unbreakable loops in redisplay.

Redisplay may loop if there is an error in some display property, e.g.
     (space 'left-margin)

A fix would be to somehow disable handling of display properties if an error
is encountered.

** Problem with cursor border around images and window-margins:

The border around the image when the cursor is on the image
flows into the right fringe and margin.

     (progn
       (auto-image-file-mode 1)
       (find-file (concat data-directory "splash.xpm"))
       (set-window-margins (selected-window) 25 25))


** Problem with modeline and window margins:

The mode line's right "box" line is misplaced under the right margin,
rather than at the right window edge.

emacs -Q
(set-window-margins nil 25 25)
C-x 2


** custom mode-line face makes Emacs freeze up

From: Stephen Berman <Stephen.Berman@gmx.net>
Date: Sun, 24 Oct 2004 02:08:56 +0200

1. Start Emacs with -q -no-site-file.

2. Type `M-x customize-face' and at the prompt `mode-line'.

3. In the Custom buffer for mode-line face
   a. check width and give it the value `narrow';
   b. check height and give it the value 120 in 1/10 pt;
   c. check underline and give it the value `on' (or `colored');
   d. check overline and give it the value `on' (or `colored').

4. Set for current session.

5. Invoke Ediff on any two files.

6. Now Emacs is frozen and consumes 95-99% of CPU.

The customizations in step 3 appear to be the minimum necessary to
induce this bug.  Leave out any one of them and Ediff runs without a
problem.  Also if the 1/10 point value of height is 130 or greater
there's no bug (with the default font family; with e.g. Helvetica the
bug is induced only by a value of 100 or less).

I've noticed this freeze up only when invoking Ediff.  The only thing
I've been able to do is kill Emacs externally, via top or with kill
when run in gdb, after interrupting.  When the freeze up happens
within a gdb session, there is no automatic debugging feedback.  After
interrupting I can get a backtrace, here's an example:


** Mouse-face overlay bleeds into header line

From: Stephen Berman <Stephen.Berman@gmx.net>
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 2004 18:11:01 +0200

Mouse-face overlays bleed into the header line when the beginning of
the overlay is above (point-min).  To reproduce:

1. Start Emacs with -q -no-site-file.

2. In *scratch* eval (setq ov (make-overlay 66 92)), (overlay-put ov
'mouse-face 'highlight), and (setq header-line-format "test").

3. Drag the mouse over the string "evaluation.\n;; If you want" and
notice the highlighting of only this string.

4. Now click on the down arrow in the scroll bar until the line
beginning ";; If you want" is directly below the header line.

5. Drag the mouse over ";; If you want" and notice that not only it
but also the header line are highlighted.


** scroll-preserve-screen-position doesn't work with a header-line-format

From: jbyler+emacs-lists@anon41.eml.cc
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 2004 17:10:14 -0400

There seems to be an off-by-one error triggered by using a header line
together with scroll-preserve-screen-position.  The symptom: instead of
staying in the same position on the screen when scrolling, the cursor
moves one screen line down each time the buffer is scrolled.  Put
another way: repeatedly typing C-v M-v or using a mouse scroll wheel to
scroll up and down causes the cursor to migrate slowly down the screen
instead of staying put as it should.

To reproduce:

emacs -q --no-site-file
(setq scroll-preserve-screen-position t)
(setq header-line-format "")
C-v M-v C-v M-v C-v M-v etc.


** Clicking on partially visible lines fails

From: David Kastrup <dak@gnu.org>
Date: 27 Apr 2004 16:42:58 +0200

This bug report will be sent to the Free Software Foundation,
not to your local site managers!
Please write in English if possible, because the Emacs maintainers
usually do not have translators to read other languages for them.

Your bug report will be posted to the emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org mailing list.

Please describe exactly what actions triggered the bug
and the precise symptoms of the bug:

I had gnus display a mouse-highlighted line (a URL from browse-url)
partially at the bottom of its window.  If I click with middle mouse
key on it, the window gets recentered while I hold the mouse key
pressed.  If I release it, the window returns into its old position
(cursor in top row) and nothing happens, presumably because the click
was not registered on the line itself, but on the magically
recentered version.

That is a nuisance.  Recentering of even partially visible click
targets should only happen if window-point moves there, but not at
the time of the click.  From the moment I hold down a key until it
gets released, the displayed window portion should not change, with
the sole exception of scrolling when dragging at the edge of the
screen.


** Can't drag modeline when mouse-autoselect-window is set

From: Klaus Zeitler <kzeitler@lucent.com>
Date: Mon, 11 Oct 2004 11:14:49 +0200

1. start emacs -q --no-site-file
2. set variable mouse-autoselect-window to t
3. split-window-vertically

now I can drag the modeline only upwards but not downwards


** line-spacing and (recenter -1)

From: SAITO Takuya <tabmore@rivo.mediatti.net>
Date: Mon, 31 May 2004 02:07:57 +0900 (JST)

(recenter -1) does not show point at the bottom of the window
if line-spacing is set to positive integer.

Start emacs -Q, and evaluate below:

(progn
  (setq line-spacing 1)
  (dotimes (i (window-height))
    (insert "\n" (int-to-string i)))
  (recenter -1))

Then, point is displayed at the center of the window.
But point should be displayed at the bottom of the window like Emacs-21.3.


** line-spacing and garbage in fringe

From: SAITO Takuya <tabmore@rivo.mediatti.net>
Date: Mon, 31 May 2004 02:08:05 +0900 (JST)

Start emacs -Q and evaluate below with C-xC-e:

(let ((lines 2)
      (spacing 1))
  (setq line-spacing spacing
	indicate-buffer-boundaries t)
  (insert (make-string (window-height) ?\n))
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (message (make-string (* (window-width) lines) ?.))
  (scroll-up 1))

then, garbage is displayed in right fringe.

Above code reproduces this bug with
(frame-parameter nil 'font)
=> "-Adobe-Courier-Medium-R-Normal--12-120-75-75-M-70-ISO8859-1"

If you use different font, you may need different value of
`lines' and/or `spacing'.


** line-spacing and Electric-pop-up-window

From: SAITO Takuya <tabmore@rivo.mediatti.net>
Date: Mon, 31 May 2004 02:08:10 +0900 (JST)

Electric-pop-up-window does not work well
if truncate long lines disabled and/or
`line-spacing' is set to positive integer.

For example, start emacs -Q --line-spacing 1, and type M-` .
Then, the last line of *Completions* buffer is not visible.

fit-window-to-buffer works well for me, so I guess
Electric-pop-up-window can use it.
