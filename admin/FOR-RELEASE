The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a period
(".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective language.
This should be followed by "See end for copying conditions", likewise
in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
