Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Check for widow and orphan lines in manuals;
make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

** Regenerate the pdf versions of the reference cards in etc/refcards/.

** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

Emacs 22 translators:

LANG	Translator            Status
cs	Pavel Janík           
de	Sven Joachim          
fr	Eric Jacoboni         
pl	Włodek Bzyl           
pt-br	Rodrigo Real          
ru	Alex Ott              
sk	Miroslav Vaško        

** Remove temporary +++/--- lines in NEWS.

** Try to reorder NEWS: most important things first, related items together.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

** lennart.borgman@gmail.com 09 Jan 2008: ps-print-buffer-with-faces hangs
If no printer is connected to the printer port that Emacs is printing
to, I/O to that port hangs in the system calls. Emacs should avoid
defaulting to a printer port that is not in use.

* BUGS WAITING FOR MORE USER INPUT

** raman@users.sf.net, sep 7: Emacs 23.0.50: Segfaults in alloc.c (batch process)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg00690.html

** undefined reference getopt_long
Report by Daniel C. Bastos <dbast0s@yahoo.com.br> on bug-gnu-emacs
from 2007-08-27.  Impossible to procede without more input from OP (as
of 20070912, emails are bouncing) or someone else who can reproduce this.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01497.html

** emacs-22.1 with GTK problems (with patches)
Only outstanding issue seems to be whether Solaris 2.6 GTK can be
supported in the absence of recursive mutexes, via a change to
alloc.c, or whether configure should abort.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00055.html

* BUGS

** Document the changes introduced by multi-tty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01639.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01602.html

** Does deleting frames run Lisp code?  If so, can we get rid of that?
It is a dangerous design.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01330.html

** Why were the calls to x_fully_uncatch_errors commented out in eval.c?
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01987.html

** grep et al should use font-lock to do highlighting, so that they respect font-lock-mode.
"can't turn off font-lock"
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg00548.html

** mah@everybody.org, Sep 18: erc causes emacs to hang with multi-tty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01765.html

** jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk, Sep 18: before-string property has no effect if display property is empty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00094.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01816.html

** sdl.web@gmail.com, Sep 24: TLS infinite loop.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01720.html

** herring@lanl.gov: find-func: can no longer find adviced subrs
This ought to work.

** \\{...} produces duplicate entries
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-05/msg00209.html

** menu indications of key bindings for remapped commands
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-05/msg01339.html

** rms: gnus-dired.el is a mistake.  Those features should not
be part of Gnus.  They should be moved to some other part of Emacs.
rsteib: Gnus dependencies in `gnus-dired.el' (and `mailcap.el') have been
minimized.  I don't know what is left to do here.

** sdl.web@gmail.com, 30 Oct: ps-lpr-switches has no effect

** timh@insightful.com, 9 Nov: X-coding-system incompatibility, and workaround

** Fix problem with mode-name in SGML mode.
If mode-name stays non-string, add NEWS entry and doc fix.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-11/msg02048.html

** multi-tty does not work correctly.
If the server is started from a tty frame and emacsclient creates an
X11 frame, the tty frame gets confused, it thinks it is an X11 frame
when trying to do a C-z.  This worked with server.el version 1.136, it
broke after that.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-12/msg00545.html
Also emacsclient does not work on Windows, it also worked with
server.el version 1.136.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg00710.html



* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language. This should be followed by "See end for copying conditions",
likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
