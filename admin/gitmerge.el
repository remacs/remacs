;;; Commentary:

;; Rewrite of bzrmerge.el, but using git.
;;
;; In a nutshell: For merging foo into master, do
;;
;; - 'git checkout master' in Emacs repository
;; - Start Emacs, cd to Emacs repository
;; - M-x gitmerge
;; - Choose branch 'foo' or 'origin/foo', depending on whether you
;;   like to merge from a local tracking branch or from the remote
;;   (does not make a difference if the local tracking branch is
;;   up-to-date).
;; - Mark commits you'd like to skip, meaning to only merge their
;;   metadata (merge strategy 'ours').
;; - Hit 'm' to start merging. Skipped commits will be merged separately.
;; - If conflicts cannot be resolved automatically, you'll have to do
;;   it manually. In that case, resolve the conflicts and restart
;;   gitmerge, which will automatically resume. It will add resolved
;;   files, commit the pending merge and continue merging the rest.
;; - Inspect master branch, and if everything looks OK, push.
