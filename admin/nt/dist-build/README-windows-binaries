Windows Binaries
================

Currently, we provide four different binary packages for Emacs, which
are:

emacs-$VERSION-x86_64.zip

Contains a 64-bit build of Emacs with dependencies. Mostly, this is
the best one to install.

emacs-$VERSION-x86_64-no-deps.zip

Contains a 64-bit build of Emacs without any dependencies. This may be
useful if you wish to install where the dependencies are already
available, or if you want the small possible Emacs.

emacs-$VERSION-i686.zip

Contains a 32-bit build of Emacs with dependencies. This is useful for
running on a 32-bit machine.

emacs-$VERSION-i686-no-deps.zip

Contains a 32-bit build of Emacs without dependencies

In addition, we provide the following files which will not be useful
for most end-users.

emacs-26-x86_64-deps.zip

The dependencies. Unzipping this file on top of
emacs-$VERSION-x86_64-no-deps.zip should result in the same install as
emacs-$VERSION-x86_64.zip.

emacs-26-i686-deps.zip

The 32-bit version of the dependencies.

emacs-26-deps-mingw-w64-src.zip

The source for the dependencies. Source for Emacs itself is available
in the main distribution tarball. These dependencies were produced
from an updated msys2 at the point of the first pre-test. It is not
intended that these will be updated after that point.
