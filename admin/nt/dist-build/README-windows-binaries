		      Precompiled Distributions of
			   Emacs for Windows

                           Jan 1, 2020

  This directory contains precompiled distributions for GNU Emacs on
  Windows

IMPORTANT LEGAL REMINDER
========================

If you want to redistribute any of the precompiled distributions of
Emacs, be careful to check the implications of the GPL.  For instance,
if you put the compiled file from this directory on an Internet site,
you must arrange to distribute the source files of the SAME version.

Making a link to our copy of the source is NOT sufficient, since we
might upgrade to a new version while you are still distributing the
old binaries.


Windows Binaries
================

Currently, we provide six different binary packages for Emacs, which
are:

emacs-$VERSION-x86_64-installer.exe

Contains a 64-bit build of Emacs with dependencies as an installer
package.  Mostly, this is the best one to install.

emacs-$VERSION-x86_64.zip

Contains a 64-bit build of Emacs with dependencies.  This contains the
same files as the installer but as a zip file which some users may
prefer.

emacs-$VERSION-x86_64-no-deps.zip

Contains a 64-bit build of Emacs without any dependencies.  This may be
useful if you wish to install where the dependencies are already
available, or if you want the small possible Emacs.

emacs-$VERSION-i686-installer.exe

Contains a 32-bit build of Emacs with dependencies as an installer
package.  This is useful for running on a 32-bit machine.

emacs-$VERSION-i686.zip

Contains a 32-bit build of Emacs with dependencies.

emacs-$VERSION-i686-no-deps.zip

Contains a 32-bit build of Emacs without dependencies

In addition, we provide the following files which will not be useful
for most end-users.

emacs-$VERSION-x86_64-deps.zip

The dependencies. Unzipping this file on top of
emacs-$VERSION-x86_64-no-deps.zip should result in the same install as
emacs-$VERSION-x86_64.zip.

emacs-27-i686-deps.zip

The 32-bit version of the dependencies.

emacs-27-deps-mingw-w64-src.zip

The source for the dependencies.  Source for Emacs itself is available
in the main distribution tarball.  These dependencies were produced
from an updated msys2 at the point of the first pre-test.  It is not
intended that these will be updated after that point.

Source for Emacs itself is found in the directory above.

Snapshots
=========

We also distribute "snapshots" of Emacs built at points throughout the
development cycle, for those interested in following this cycle.  They
are not recommended for normal users.

The files follow the same naming convention, but also include a date
(and sometimes information about their branch).  The Emacs source at
the time of these builds is also distributed.
