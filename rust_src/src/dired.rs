/// Return a list of attributes of file FILENAME.
/// Value is nil if specified file cannot be opened.
///
/// ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid (see
/// below) - valid values are `string' and `integer'.  The latter is the
/// default, but we plan to change that, so you should specify a non-nil value
/// for ID-FORMAT if you use the returned uid or gid.
///
/// To access the elements returned, the following access functions are
/// provided: `file-attribute-type', `file-attribute-link-number',
/// `file-attribute-user-id', `file-attribute-group-id',
/// `file-attribute-access-time', `file-attribute-modification-time',
/// `file-attribute-status-change-time', `file-attribute-size',
/// `file-attribute-modes', `file-attribute-inode-number', and
/// `file-attribute-device-number'.
///
/// Elements of the attribute list are:
///  0. t for directory, string (name linked to) for symbolic link, or nil.
///  1. Number of links to file.
///  2. File uid as a string or a number.  If a string value cannot be
///   looked up, a numeric value, either an integer or a float, is returned.
///  3. File gid, likewise.
///  4. Last access time, as a list of integers (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC) in the
///   same style as (current-time).
///   (See a note below about access time on FAT-based filesystems.)
///  5. Last modification time, likewise.  This is the time of the last
///   change to the file's contents.
///  6. Last status change time, likewise.  This is the time of last change
///   to the file's attributes: owner and group, access mode bits, etc.
///  7. Size in bytes.
///   This is a floating point number if the size is too large for an integer.
///  8. File modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes as in ls -l.
///  9. An unspecified value, present only for backward compatibility.
/// 10. inode number.  If it is larger than what an Emacs integer can hold,
///   this is of the form (HIGH . LOW): first the high bits, then the low 16 bits.
///   If even HIGH is too large for an Emacs integer, this is instead of the form
///   (HIGH MIDDLE . LOW): first the high bits, then the middle 24 bits,
///   and finally the low 16 bits.
/// 11. Filesystem device number.  If it is larger than what the Emacs
///   integer can hold, this is a cons cell, similar to the inode number.
///
/// On most filesystems, the combination of the inode and the device
/// number uniquely identifies the file.
///
/// On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',
/// which see.
///
/// On some FAT-based filesystems, only the date of last access is recorded,
/// so last access time will always be midnight of that day.
