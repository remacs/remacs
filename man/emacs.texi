@unnumbered Preface

  This manual documents the use and simple customization of the Emacs
editor.  Simple Emacs customizations do not require you to be a
programmer, but if you are not interested in customizing, you can
ignore the customization hints.

  This is primarily a reference manual, but can also be used as a
primer.  If you are new to Emacs, we recommend you start with
the on-line, learn-by-doing tutorial, before reading the manual.  To
run the tutorial, start Emacs and type @kbd{C-h t}.  The tutorial
describes commands, tells you when to try them, and explains the
results.

  On first reading, just skim chapters 1 and 2, which describe the
notational conventions of the manual and the general appearance of the
Emacs display screen.  Note which questions are answered in these
chapters, so you can refer back later.  After reading chapter 4, you
should practice the commands shown there.  The next few chapters
describe fundamental techniques and concepts that are used constantly.
You need to understand them thoroughly, so experiment with them
until you are fluent.

  Chapters 14 through 19 describe intermediate-level features that are
useful for many kinds of editing.  Chapter 20 and following chapters
describe optional but useful features; read those chapters when you
need them.

  Read the Trouble chapter if Emacs does not seem to be working
properly.  It explains how to cope with several common problems
(@pxref{Lossage}), as well as when and how to report Emacs bugs
(@pxref{Bugs}).

  To find the documentation of a particular command, look in the index.
Keys (character commands) and command names have separate indexes.
There is also a glossary, with a cross reference for each term.

  This manual is available as a printed book and also as an Info file.
The Info file is for on-line perusal with the Info program, which is
the principal means of accessing on-line documentation in the GNU
system.  Both the Emacs Info file and an Info reader are included with
GNU Emacs.  The Info file and the printed book contain substantially
the same text and are generated from the same source files, which are
also distributed with GNU Emacs.

  GNU Emacs is a member of the Emacs editor family.  There are many
Emacs editors, all sharing common principles of organization.  For
information on the underlying philosophy of Emacs and the lessons
learned from its development, see @cite{Emacs, the Extensible,
Customizable Self-Documenting Display Editor}, available from
@url{ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-519A.pdf}.

This edition of the manual is intended for use with GNU Emacs
installed on GNU and Unix systems.  GNU Emacs can also be used on VMS,
MS-DOS (also called MS-DOG), Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh systems.
Those systems use different file name syntax; in addition, VMS and
MS-DOS do not support all GNU Emacs features.  @xref{Microsoft
Windows}, for information about using Emacs on Windows.
@xref{Mac OS}, for information about using Emacs on Macintosh.  We
don't try to describe VMS usage in this manual.

@unnumbered Distribution

GNU Emacs is @dfn{free software}; this means that everyone is free to
use it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  GNU Emacs
is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of GNU Emacs that they might get from you.  The precise
conditions are found in the GNU General Public License that comes with
Emacs and also appears in this manual@footnote{This manual is itself
covered by the GNU Free Documentation License.  This license is
similar in spirit to the General Public License, but is more suitable
for documentation.  @xref{GNU Free Documentation License}.}.
@xref{Copying}.

One way to get a copy of GNU Emacs is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask for our permission to do so, or tell any one else;
just copy it.  If you have access to the Internet, you can get the
latest distribution version of GNU Emacs by anonymous FTP; see
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs} on our website for more
information.

You may also receive GNU Emacs when you buy a computer.  Computer
manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the same terms that apply to
everyone else.  These terms require them to give you the full sources,
including whatever changes they may have made, and to permit you to
redistribute the GNU Emacs received from them under the usual terms of the
General Public License.  In other words, the program must be free for you
when you get it, not just free for the manufacturer.

You can also order copies of GNU Emacs from the Free Software
Foundation.  This is a convenient and reliable way to get a copy; it is
also a good way to help fund our work.  We also sell hardcopy versions
of this manual and @cite{An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp},
by Robert J. Chassell.  You can find an order form on our web site at

The income from distribution fees goes to support the foundation's
purpose: the development of new free software, and improvements to our
existing programs including GNU Emacs.

If you find GNU Emacs useful, please @strong{send a donation} to the
Free Software Foundation to support our work.  Donations to the Free
Software Foundation are tax deductible in the US.  If you use GNU Emacs
at your workplace, please suggest that the company make a donation.  If
company policy is unsympathetic to the idea of donating to charity, you
might instead suggest ordering a CD-ROM from the Foundation
occasionally, or subscribing to periodic updates.

@unnumbered Introduction

  You are reading about GNU Emacs, the GNU incarnation of the
advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible editor Emacs.
(The `G' in `GNU' is not silent.)

  We call Emacs advanced because it provides much more than simple
insertion and deletion.  It can control subprocesses, indent programs
automatically, show two or more files at once, and edit formatted
text.  Emacs editing commands operate in terms of characters, words,
lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as expressions and
comments in various programming languages.

  @dfn{Self-documenting} means that at any time you can type a special
character, @kbd{Control-h}, to find out what your options are.  You can
also use it to find out what any command does, or to find all the commands
that pertain to a topic.  @xref{Help}.

  @dfn{Customizable} means that you can alter Emacs commands' behavior
in simple ways.  For example, if you use a programming language in
which comments start with @samp{<**} and end with @samp{**>}, you can
tell the Emacs comment manipulation commands to use those strings
(@pxref{Comments}).  Another sort of customization is rearrangement of
the command set.  For example, you can rebind the basic cursor motion
commands (up, down, left and right) to any keys on the keyboard that
you find comfortable.  @xref{Customization}.

  @dfn{Extensible} means that you can go beyond simple customization
and write entirely new commands---programs in the Lisp language to be
run by Emacs's own Lisp interpreter.  Emacs is an ``on-line
extensible'' system, which means that it is divided into many
functions that call each other, any of which can be redefined in the
middle of an editing session.  Almost any part of Emacs can be
replaced without making a separate copy of all of Emacs.  Most of the
editing commands of Emacs are written in Lisp; the few exceptions
could have been written in Lisp but use C instead for efficiency.
Writing an extension is programming, but non-programmers can use it
afterwards.  @xref{Top, Emacs Lisp Intro, Preface, eintr, An
Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp}, if you want to learn Emacs
Lisp programming.

   When running on a graphical display, Emacs provides its own menus
and convenient handling of mouse buttons.  In addition, Emacs provides
many of the benefits of a graphical display even on a text-only
terminal.  For instance, it can highlight parts of a file, display and
edit several files at once, move text between files, and edit files
while running shell commands.

@c The Option Index is produced only in the on-line version,
@c because the index entries related to command-line options
@c tend to point to the same pages and all begin with a dash.
@c This, and the need to keep the node links consistent, are
@c the reasons for the funky @iftex/@ifnottex dance below.
@c The Option Index is _not_ before Key Index, because that
@c would require changes in the glossary.texi's @node line.
@c It is not after Concept Index for similar reasons.
