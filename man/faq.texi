@end itemize

Key sequences longer than one key (and some single-key sequences) are
inside double quotes or on lines by themselves.  Any real spaces in such
a key sequence should be ignored; only @key{SPC} really means press the
space key.

The ASCII code sent by @kbd{C-x} (except for @kbd{C-?}) is the value
that would be sent by pressing just @key{x} minus 96 (or 64 for
uppercase @key{X}) and will be from 0 to 31.  The ASCII code sent by
@kbd{M-x} is the sum of 128 and the ASCII code that would be sent by
pressing just @key{x}.  Essentially, @key{Control} turns off bits 5 and
6 and @key{Meta} turns on bit 7.

@kbd{C-?} (aka @key{DEL}) is ASCII code 127.  It is a misnomer to call
@kbd{C-?}  a "control" key, since 127 has both bits 5 and 6 turned ON.
Also, on very few keyboards does @kbd{C-?} generate ASCII code 127.

command, then type @key{RET}.  (@pxref{Basic keys} if you're not sure
what @kbd{M-x} and @key{RET} mean.)

@kbd{M-x} (by default) invokes the command
@code{execute-extended-command}.  This command allows you to run any
Emacs command if you can remember the command's name.  If you can't
remember the command's name, you can type @key{TAB} and @key{SPC} for
completion, @key{?} for a list of possibilities, and @kbd{M-p} and
@kbd{M-n} to see previous commands entered.  An Emacs "command" is any
"interactive" Emacs function.

Your system administrator may have bound other key sequences to invoke
@code{execute-extended-command}.  A function key labeled @kbd{Do} is a
good candidate for this.

When we refer you to topic XXX in the on-line manual, you can read this

This invokes Info, the GNU hypertext documentation browser.  If you don't
already know how to use Info, type @key{?} from within Info.

If we refer to topic XXX:YYY, type @kbd{C-h i m emacs @key{RET} m XXX
@key{RET} m YYY @key{RET}}.

Your system administrator may not have installed the Info files, or may
have installed them improperly.  In this case you should complain.

@cindex Filename conventions
@cindex Conventions for filenames
@cindex Directories and files that come with Emacs

These are files that come with Emacs.  The Emacs distribution is divided
into subdirectories; the important ones are @file{etc}, @file{lisp}, and
@file{src}.

If you use Emacs, but don't know where it is kept on your system, start
Emacs, then type @kbd{C-h v data-directory @key{RET}}.  The directory
name displayed by this will be the full pathname of the installed
@file{etc} directory.

The location of your Info directory (i.e., where on-line documentation
is stored) is kept in the variable @code{Info-default-directory-list}.  Use
@kbd{C-h v Info-default-directory-list @key{RET}} to see the contents of
this variable, which will be a list of directory names.  The last
directory in that list is probably where most Info files are stored.  By
default, Info documentation is placed in @file{/usr/local/info}.

Some of these files are available individually via FTP or e-mail;
@pxref{Informational files for Emacs}.  All are available in the source
distribution.  Many of the files in the @file{etc} directory are also
available via the Emacs "help" menu, or by typing @kbd{C-h ?} (@kbd{M-x
help-for-help}).

Your system administrator may have removed the @file{src} directory and
many files from the @file{etc} directory.

Avoid confusing the FSF, the LPF, and the OSF.  The LPF opposes
look-and-feel copyrights and software patents.  The FSF aims to make
high quality free software available for everyone.  The OSF is a
consortium of computer vendors which develops commercial software for
Unix systems.

The word "free" in the title of the Free Software Foundation refers to
"freedom," not "zero dollars."  Anyone can charge any price for
GPL-covered software that they want to.  However, in practice, the
freedom enforced by the GPL leads to low prices, because you can always
get the software for less money from someone else, because everyone has
the right to resell or give away GPL-covered software.

@cindex Discussion of the GPL

The real legal meaning of the GNU General Public License (copyleft) will
only be known if and when a judge rules on its validity and scope.
There has never been a copyright infringement case involving the GPL to
set any precedents.  Please take any discussion regarding this issue to
the newsgroup @uref{news:gnu.misc.discuss}, which was created to hold the
extensive flame wars on the subject.

RMS writes:

@quotation
The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than the spirit,
which is that Emacs is a free software project and that work pertaining
to Emacs should also be free software.  "Free" means that all users have
the freedom to study, share, change and improve Emacs.  To make sure
everyone has this freedom, pass along source code when you distribute
any version of Emacs or a related program, and give the recipients the
same freedom that you enjoyed.

The file @file{etc/MAILINGLISTS} discusses the purpose of each GNU
mailing-list.  (@pxref{Informational files for Emacs} if you want a copy
of the file.)  For those lists which are gatewayed with newsgroups, it
lists both the newsgroup name and the mailing list address.

@uref{news:comp.emacs} is for discussion of Emacs programs in general.
This includes Emacs along with various other implementations, such as
JOVE, MicroEmacs, Freemacs, MG, Unipress, CCA, and Epsilon.

Many people post Emacs questions to @uref{news:comp.emacs} because they
don't receive any of the gnu.* newsgroups.  Arguments have been made
both for and against posting GNU-Emacs-specific material to
@uref{news:comp.emacs}.  You have to decide for yourself.

Messages advocating "non-free" software are considered unacceptable on
any of the gnu.* newsgroups except for @uref{news:gnu.misc.discuss},
which was created to hold the extensive flame-wars on the subject.
"Non-free" software includes any software for which the end user can't
freely modify the source code and exchange enhancements.  Be careful to
remove the gnu.* groups from the "Newsgroups:" line when posting a
followup that recommends such software.

@uref{news:gnu.emacs.bug} is a place where bug reports appear, but avoid
posting bug reports to this newsgroup (@pxref{Reporting bugs}).

The FSF has maintained archives of all of the GNU mailing lists for many
years, although there may be some unintentional gaps in coverage.  The
archive is not particularly well organized or easy to retrieve
individual postings from, but pretty much everything is there.

The archive is at @uref{ftp://ftp-mailing-list-archives.gnu.org}.

As of this writing, the archives are not yet working.

Web-based Usenet search services, such as
@uref{http://www.dejanews.com, DejaNews}, also archive the

@section Where should I report bugs and other problems with Emacs?
@cindex Bug reporting
@cindex Good bug reports
@cindex How to submit a bug report
@cindex Reporting bugs

The correct way to report Emacs bugs is by e-mail to
@email{bug-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org}.  Anything sent here also appears in the
newsgroup @uref{news:gnu.emacs.bug}, but please use e-mail instead of
news to submit the bug report.  This ensures a reliable return address
so you can be contacted for further details.

Be sure to read the "Bugs" section of the Emacs manual before reporting
a bug to bug-gnu-emacs!  The manual describes in detail how to submit a
useful bug report.  (@pxref{On-line manual} if you don't know how to read the
manual.)

RMS says:

@quotation
Sending bug reports to @email{help-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org} (which has the
effect of posting on @uref{news:gnu.emacs.help}) is undesirable because
it takes the time of an unnecessarily large group of people, most of
whom are just users and have no idea how to fix these problem.
@email{bug-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org} reaches a much smaller group of people
who are more likely to know what to do and have expressed a wish to
receive more messages about Emacs than the others.
@end quotation

RMS says it is sometimes fine to post to @uref{news:gnu.emacs.help}:

@quotation
If you have reported a bug and you don't hear about a possible fix,
then after a suitable delay (such as a week) it is okay to post on
gnu.emacs.help asking if anyone can help you.
@end quotation

If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, consider the following
non-exhaustive list, courtesy of RMS:

@quotation
If Emacs crashes, that is a bug.  If Emacs gets compilation errors
while building, that is a bug.  If Emacs crashes while building, that
is a bug.  If Lisp code does not do what the documentation says it
does, that is a bug.

distribution point you are listed.  Inspecting the @samp{Received} headers
on the mail messages may help, along with liberal use of the "EXPN" or

First, you must turn the Texinfo files into Info files.  You may do this
using the stand-alone @file{makeinfo} program, available as part of the latest
Texinfo package at

@uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-3.12.tar.gz}

and all mirrors of @samp{ftp.gnu.org} (@pxref{Current GNU distributions} for a list).

For information about the Texinfo format, read the Texinfo manual which
comes with Emacs.  This manual also comes installed in Info format, so
you can read it on-line.

Neither @code{texinfo-format-buffer} nor @file{makeinfo} installs the
resulting Info files in Emacs's Info tree.  To install Info files:

@enumerate

@item Move the files to the @file{info} directory in the installed Emacs
 distribution.  @xref{Filename conventions}, if you don't know where that is.

@item Edit the file @file{info/dir} in the installed Emacs distribution,

pressing @key{g} in Info mode) by typing the name of the file in
parentheses.  This goes to the node named "Top" in that file.  For
example, to view a Info file named "XXX" in your home directory, you can
type this:

@lisp
C-h i g (~/XXX) @key{RET}
@end lisp

@item
You can create your own Info directory.  You can tell Emacs where the
Info directory is by adding its pathname to the value of the variable
@code{Info-default-directory-list}.  For example, to use a private Info
directory which is a subdirectory of your home directory named "Info",
you could put this in your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(setq Info-default-directory-list
      (cons "~/Info" Info-default-directory-list))
@end lisp

You will need a top-level Info file named @file{dir} in this directory
which has everything the system dir file has in it, except it should
list only entries for Info files in that directory.  You might not need
it if all files in this directory were referenced by other @file{dir}
files.  The node lists from all @file{dir} files in
@code{Info-default-directory-list} are merged by the Info system.

to read any news article that is still in the news spool, even if you
have read the article before.  You may need to read the instructions for
your news reader to discover how to do this.  In @file{rn}, this command
will do this for you at the article selection level:

In Gnus, you should type @kbd{C-u C-x C-s} from the @file{*Summary*}
buffer or @kbd{C-u @key{SPC}} from the @file{*Newsgroup*} buffer to view
all articles in a newsgroup.

If the FAQ articles have expired and been deleted from your news spool,
it might (or might not) do some good to complain to your news
administrator, because the most recent FAQ should not expire for a
while.

@cindex Emacs name origin
@cindex TECO
@cindex Original version of Emacs

Emacs originally was an acronym for Editor MACroS.  RMS says he "picked
the name Emacs because @key{E} was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at
the time."  The first Emacs was a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT
by RMS for the editor TECO (Text Editor and COrrector, originally Tape
Editor and COrrector) under ITS on a PDP-10.  RMS had already extended
TECO with a "real-time" full screen mode with reprogrammable keys.
Emacs was started by @email{gls@@east.sun.com, Guy Steele} as a project
to unify the many divergent TECO command sets and key bindings at MIT,
and completed by RMS.

Many people have said that TECO code looks a lot like line noise; you
can read more at @uref{news:alt.lang.teco}.  Someone has written a TECO
implementation in Emacs Lisp (to find it, @ref{Packages that do not come
with Emacs}); it would be an interesting project to run the original
TECO Emacs inside of Emacs.

For some not-so-serious alternative reasons for Emacs to have that
name, check out @file{etc/JOKES} (@pxref{Filename conventions}).

(@kbd{M-x view-emacs-news}).  The oldest changes are at the bottom of
the file, so you might want to read it starting there, rather than at
the top.

The differences between Emacs versions 18 and 19 was rather dramatic;
the introduction of frames, faces, and colors on windowing systems was
obvious to even the most casual user.

There are differences between Emacs versions 19 and 20 as well, but many
are more subtle or harder to find.  Among the changes are the inclusion
of MULE code for languages that use non-Latin characters, the "customize"
facility for modifying variables without having to use Lisp, and
automatic conversion of files from Macintosh, Microsoft, and Unix
platforms.

A number of older Lisp packages, such as Gnus, Supercite and the
calendar/diary, have been updated and enhanced to work with Emacs 20,
and are now included with the standard distribution.

@inforef{Init File, Init File, emacs}

In general, new Emacs users should not have @file{.emacs} files, because
it causes confusing non-standard behavior.  Then they send questions to
@email{help-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org} asking why Emacs isn't behaving as
documented.

Emacs 20 includes the new @code{customize} facility, which can be
invoked using @kbd{M-x customize @key{RET}}.  This allows users who are
unfamiliar with Emacs Lisp to modify their @file{.emacs} files in a
relatively straightforward way, using menus rather than Lisp code.  Not
all packages support Customize as of this writing, but the number is
growing fairly steadily.

While @code{customize} might indeed make it easier to configure Emacs,
consider taking a bit of time to learn Emacs Lisp and modifying your
@file{.emacs} directly. Simple configuration options are described
rather completely in @inforef{Init File, Init File, emacs}, for users
interested in performing frequently requested, basic tasks.

@section How do I debug a @file{.emacs} file?
@cindex Debugging @file{.emacs} file
@cindex @file{.emacs} debugging
@cindex Init file debugging
@cindex @samp{-debug-init}

Start Emacs with the @samp{-debug-init} command-line option.  This
enables the Emacs Lisp debugger before evaluating your @file{.emacs}
file, and places you in the debugger if something goes wrong.  The top
line in the @file{trace-back} buffer will be the error message, and the
second or third line of that buffer will display the Lisp code from your
@file{.emacs} file that caused the problem.

You can also evaluate an individual function or argument to a function
in your @file{.emacs} file by moving the cursor to the end of the
function or argument and typing @kbd{C-x C-e} (@kbd{M-x
eval-last-sexp}).

Use @kbd{C-h v} (@kbd{M-x describe-variable}) to check the value of
variables which you are trying to set or use.

@cindex @code{mode-line-format}

To have Emacs automatically display the current line number of the point
in the mode line, do @kbd{M-x line-number-mode}.  You can also put the
form

@lisp
(setq line-number-mode t)
@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file to achieve this whenever you start Emacs.
Note that Emacs will not display the line number if the buffer is larger
than the value of the variable @code{line-number-display-limit}.

As of Emacs 20, you can similarly display the current column with
@kbd{M-x column-number-mode}, or by putting the form

@lisp
(setq column-number-mode t) 
@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file.

The "%c" format specifier in the variable @code{mode-line-format} will
insert the current column's value into the mode line.  See the
documentation for @code{mode-line-format} (using @kbd{C-h v
mode-line-format @key{RET}}) for more information on how to set and use
this variable.

Users of all Emacs versions can display the current column using
@email{abraham@@iesd.auc.dk, Per Abrahamsen's} "column" package.
@xref{Packages that do not come with Emacs}, for instructions on how to
get it.

None of the vi emulation modes provide the "set number" capability of vi
(as far as we know).

@section How can I modify the titlebar to contain the current filename?
@cindex Titlebar, displaying the current filename in
@cindex Filename, displaying in the titlebar
@cindex @code{frame-title-format}

The contains of an Emacs frame's titlebar is controlled by the variable
@code{frame-title-format}, which has the same structure as the variable
@code{mode-line-format}.  (Use @kbd{C-h v} or @kbd{M-x
describe-variable} to get information about one or both of these
variables.)

By default, the titlebar for a frame does contain the name of the buffer
currently being visited, except if there is a single frame.  In such a
case, the titlebar contains the name of the user and the machine at
which Emacs was invoked.  This is done by setting
@code{frame-title-format} to the default value of

@lisp
(multiple-frames "%b" ("" invocation-name "@@" system-name))
@end lisp

To modify the behavior such that frame titlebars contain the buffer's
name regardless of the number of existing frames, include the following
in your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(setq frame-title-format "%b")
@end lisp

@cindex Automatic entry to @code{auto-fill-mode}

To turn on @code{auto-fill-mode} just once for one buffer, use @kbd{M-x
auto-fill-mode}.

To turn it on for every buffer in a certain mode, you must use the hook
for that mode.  For example, to turn on @code{auto-fill} mode for all
text buffers, including the following in your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
@end lisp

@end lisp

Otherwise put this somewhere in the first line of any file you want to
edit in XXX mode (in the second line, if the first line begins with
@samp{#!}):

@example
-*-XXX-*-
@end example

Beginning with Emacs 19, the variable @code{interpreter-mode-alist}
specifies which mode to use when loading a shell script.  (Emacs
determines which interpreter you're using by examining the first line of
the file.)  This feature only applies when the file name doesn't
indicate which mode to use.  Use @kbd{C-h v} (or @kbd{M-x
describe-variable}) on @code{interpreter-mode-alist} to learn more.

@cindex Regexps and unprintable characters

To search for a single character that appears in the buffer as, for
example, @samp{\237}, you can type @kbd{C-s C-q 2 3 7}.  (This assumes
the value of @code{search-quote-char} is 17 (i.e., @kbd{C-q}).)
Searching for ALL unprintable characters is best done with a regular
expression ("regexp") search.  The easiest regexp to use for the
unprintable chars is the complement of the regexp for the printable
chars.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Regexp for the printable chars: @samp{[\t\n\r\f -~]}

@item
Regexp for the unprintable chars: @samp{[^\t\n\r\f -~]}

@end itemize

To type these special characters in an interactive argument to
@code{isearch-forward-regexp} or @code{re-search-forward}, you need to
use @kbd{C-q}.  (@samp{\t}, @samp{\n}, @samp{\r}, and @samp{\f} stand
respectively for @key{TAB}, @key{LFD}, @key{RET}, and @kbd{C-l}.)  So,
to search for unprintable characters using @code{re-search-forward}:

@kbd{M-x re-search-forward @key{RET} [^ @key{TAB} C-q @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~] @key{RET}}

Using @code{isearch-forward-regexp}:

@kbd{M-C-s [^ @key{TAB} @key{RET} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~]}

To delete all unprintable characters, simply use replace-regexp:

@kbd{M-x replace-regexp @key{RET} [^ @key{TAB} C-q @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~] @key{RET} @key{RET}}

Replacing is similar to the above.  To replace all unprintable
characters with a colon, use:

M-x replace-regexp @key{RET} [^ @key{TAB} C-q @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~] @key{RET} : @key{RET}

@end lisp

Similarly, for replacing the variable @code{case-replace} determines

To change the case sensitivity just for one major mode, use the major

@cindex @code{emacsclient}
@cindex Emacs server functions
@cindex Using an existing Emacs process

@code{emacsclient}, which comes with Emacs, is for editing a file using
an already running Emacs rather than starting up a new Emacs.  It does
this by sending a request to the already running Emacs, which must be
expecting the request.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Setup

Emacs must have executed the @code{server-start} function for
@samp{emacsclient} to work.  This can be done either by a command line
option:

@example
emacs -f server-start
@end example

or by invoking @code{server-start} from @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(if (some conditions are met) (server-start))
@end lisp

When this is done, Emacs starts a subprocess running a program called
@samp{server}.  @samp{server} creates a Unix domain socket, named
@file{.emacs_server}, in the user's home directory.

To get your news reader, mail reader, etc., to invoke
@samp{emacsclient}, try setting the environment variable @code{EDITOR}
(or sometimes @code{VISUAL}) to the value @samp{emacsclient}.  You may
have to specify the full pathname of the @samp{emacsclient} program
instead.  Examples:

@example
# csh commands:
setenv EDITOR emacsclient

# using full pathname
setenv EDITOR /usr/local/emacs/etc/emacsclient  

# sh command:
EDITOR=emacsclient ; export EDITOR
@end example

@item Normal use

When @samp{emacsclient} is run, it connects to the @file{.emacs_server}
socket and passes its command line options to @samp{server}.  When
@samp{server} receives these requests, it sends this information on the
the Emacs process, which at the next opportunity will visit the files
specified.  (Line numbers can be specified just like with Emacs.)  The
user will have to switch to the Emacs window by hand.  When the user is
done editing a file, the user can type @kbd{C-x #} (or @kbd{M-x
server-edit}) to indicate this.  If there is another buffer requested by
emacsclient, Emacs will switch to it; otherwise emacsclient will exit,
signaling the calling program to continue.

@samp{emacsclient} and @samp{server} must be running on machines which
share the same filesystem for this to work.  The pathnames that
@samp{emacsclient} specifies should be correct for the filesystem that
the Emacs process sees.  The Emacs process should not be suspended at
the time @samp{emacsclient} is invoked.  @samp{emacsclient} should
either be invoked from another X window or from a shell window inside
Emacs itself.

There is an enhanced version of @samp{emacsclient}/server called
@samp{gnuserv} by @email{ange@@hplb.hpl.hp.com, Andy Norman} which is
available in the Emacs Lisp Archive (@pxref{Packages that do not come
with Emacs}).  @samp{gnuserv} uses Internet domain sockets, so it can
work across most network connections.  It also supports the execution of
arbitrary Emacs Lisp forms and does not require the client program to
wait for completion.

The alpha version of an enhanced @samp{gnuserv} is available
at

The variable @code{compilation-error-regexp-alist} helps control how
Emacs parses your compiler output.  It is a list of triples of the form:
@code{(@var{regexp} @var{file-idx} @var{line-idx})}, where @var{regexp}, @var{file-idx} and

to see the current value.  A good idea is to look at @file{compile.el}
itself as the comments included for this variable are quite useful ---
the regular expressions required for your compiler's output may be very
close to one already provided.  Once you have determined the proper
regexps, use the following to inform Emacs of your changes:

The solution at first appears to be: set @code{c-indent-level} to 4 and
@code{c-label-offset} to -2.  However, this will give you an indentation
spacing of four instead of two.

The solution is to use @code{cc-mode} (the default mode for C
programming in Emacs 20) and add the following line:

@lisp
(c-set-offset 'case-label '+)

There appears to be no way to do this with the old @code{c-mode}.

Such behavior is automatic in Emacs 20.  From the NEWS file for Emacs
20.2:

@example
** In Text mode, now only blank lines separate paragraphs.  This makes
it possible to get the full benefit of Adaptive Fill mode in Text mode,
and other modes derived from it (such as Mail mode).  @key{TAB} in Text
mode now runs the command @code{indent-relative}; this makes a practical
difference only when you use indented paragraphs.

As a result, the old Indented Text mode is now identical to Text mode,
and is an alias for it.

If you want spaces at the beginning of a line to start a paragraph, use
the new mode, Paragraph Indent Text mode.
@end example

If you have @code{auto-fill-mode} on (@pxref{Turning on auto-fill by
default}), you can tell Emacs to prefix every line with a certain
character sequence, the "fill prefix."  Type the prefix at the beginning
of a line, position point after it, and then type @kbd{C-x .}
(@code{set-fill-prefix}) to set the fill prefix.  Thereafter,
auto-filling will automatically put the fill prefix at the beginning of
new lines, and @kbd{M-q} (@code{fill-paragraph}) will maintain any fill
prefix when refilling the paragraph.

If you have paragraphs with different levels of indentation, you will
have to set the fill prefix to the correct value each time you move to a
new paragraph.  To avoid this hassle, try one of the many packages
available from the Emacs Lisp Archive (@pxref{Packages that do not come
with Emacs}.)  Look up "fill" and "indent" in the Lisp Code Directory
for guidance.

will be inserted in the buffer.

@item

before or around point.

@item
Typing @kbd{C-x C-e} in any buffer evaluates the Lisp form immediately
before point and prints its value in the echo area.

@item
Typing @kbd{M-:} or @kbd{M-x eval-expression} allows you to type a Lisp
form in the minibuffer which will be evaluated.

@item
You can use @kbd{M-x load-file} to have Emacs evaluate all the Lisp
forms in a file.  (To do this from Lisp use the function @code{load}
instead.)

The functions @code{load-library}, @code{eval-region},
@code{eval-current-buffer}, @code{require}, and @code{autoload} are also
useful; @pxref{Emacs Lisp documentation} if you want to learn more about

Instead, you might want to change the variable

longer between auto-saves, which might annoy you less.

@cindex Keymaps and menus

Each menu title (e.g., Buffers, File, Edit) represents a local or global
keymap.  Selecting a menu title with the mouse displays that keymap's
non-nil contents in the form of a menu.

So to add a menu option to an existing menu, all you have to do is add a
new definition to the appropriate keymap.  Adding a "forward word"
command to the "Edit" menu thus requires the following Lisp code:

@lisp
(define-key global-map           
  [menu-bar edit forward]        
  '("Forward word" . forward-word))
@end lisp

The first line adds the entry to the global keymap, which includes
global menu bar entries.  Replacing the reference to @code{global-map}
with a local keymap would add this menu option only within a particular
mode.

The second line describes the path from the menu-bar to the new entry.
Placing this menu entry underneath the "File" menu would mean changing
the word "edit" in the second line to "file."

The third line is a cons cell whose first element is the title that will
be displayed, and whose second element is the function that will be
called when that menu option is invoked.

To add a new menu, rather than a new option to an existing menu, we must
define an entirely new keymap:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar words]
  (cons "Words" (make-sparse-keymap "Words")))
@end lisp

The above code creates a new sparse keymap, gives it the name "Words",
and attaches it to the global menu bar.  Adding the "forward word"
command to this new menu would thus require the following code:

@lisp
(define-key global-map
  [menu-bar words forward]
  '("Forward word" . forward-word))
@end lisp

Note that because of the way keymaps work, menu options are displayed
with the more recently defined items at the top.  Thus if you were to
define menu options "foo", "bar", and "baz" (in that order), menu option
"baz" would appear at the top, and "foo" would be at the bottom.

One way to avoid this problem is to use the function @code{define-key-after},
which works the same as @code{define-key}, but lets you modify where items
appear.  The following Lisp code would insert the "forward word" function
in the "edit" menu immediately following the "undo" option:

@lisp
(define-key-after
  (lookup-key global-map [menu-bar edit])
  [forward]
  '("Forward word" . forward-word)
  'undo)
@end lisp

Note how the second and third arguments to @code{define-key-after} are
different from those of @code{define-key}, and that we have added a new
(final) argument, the function after which our new key should be
defined.

To move a menu option from one position to another, simply evaluate

"Keymaps".  (@pxref{Emacs Lisp documentation} for information on this

@node Deleting menus and menu options, Turning on syntax highlighting, Modifying pull-down menus, Common requests
@section How do I delete menus and menu options?
@cindex Deleting menus and menu options
@cindex Menus, deleting

The simplest way to remove a menu is to set its keymap to @samp{nil}.
For example, to delete the "Words" menu (@pxref{Modifying pull-down
menus}), use:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar words] nil)
@end lisp

Similarly, removing a menu option requires redefining a keymap entry to
@code{nil}.  For example, to delete the "Forward word" menu option from the
"Edit" menu (we added it in @ref{Modifying pull-down menus}), use:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar edit forward] nil)
@end lisp

@cindex Syntax highlighting
@cindex @code{font-lock-mode}
@cindex Highlighting based on syntax
@cindex Colorizing text
@cindex FAQ, @code{font-lock-mode}

@code{font-lock-mode} is the standard way to have Emacs perform syntax
highlighting.  With @code{font-lock-mode} invoked, different types of
text will appear in different colors.  For instance, if you turn on
@code{font-lock-mode} in a programming mode, variables will appear in one
face, keywords in a second, and comments in a third.

Earlier versions of Emacs supported hilit19, a similar package.  Use of
hilit19 is now considered non-standard, although @file{hilit19.el} comes
with the stock Emacs distribution.  It is no longer maintained.

To turn @code{font-lock-mode} on within an existing buffer, use @kbd{M-x
font-lock-mode @key{RET}}.

To automatically invoke @code{font-lock-mode} when a particular major
mode is invoked, set the major mode's hook.  For example, to fontify all
@code{c-mode} buffers, add the following to your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)
@end lisp

To automatically invoke @code{font-lock-mode} for all major modes, you
can turn on @code{global-font-lock-mode} by including the following line
in your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(global-font-lock-mode 1)
@end lisp

This instructs Emacs to turn on font-lock mode in those buffers for
which a font-lock mode definition has been provided (in the variable
@code{font-lock-global-modes}).  If you edit a file in
@code{pie-ala-mode}, and no font-lock definitions have been provided for
@code{pie-ala} files, then the above setting will have no effect on that
particular buffer.

Highlighting with @code{font-lock-mode} can take quite a while, and thus
different levels of decoration are available, from slight to gaudy.  To
control how decorated your buffers should become, set the value of
@code{font-lock-maximum-decoration} in your @file{.emacs} file, with a
@code{nil} value indicating default (usually minimum) decoration, and a
@code{t} value indicating the maximum decoration.  For the gaudiest
possible look, then, include the line

@lisp
(setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)
@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file.  You can also set this variable such that
different modes are highlighted in a different ways; for more
information, see the documentation for
@code{font-lock-maximum-decoration} with @kbd{C-h v} (or @kbd{M-x
describe-variable @key{RET}}).

You might also want to investigate @code{fast-lock-mode} and
@code{lazy-lock-mode}, versions of @code{font-lock-mode} that speed up
highlighting.  The advantage of @code{lazy-lock-mode} is that it only
fontifies buffers when certain conditions are met, such as after a
certain amount of idle time, or after you have finished scrolling
through text.  See the documentation for @code{lazy-lock-mode} by typing @kbd{C-h f
@code{lazy-lock-mode}} (@kbd{M-x describe-function @key{RET}
lazy-lock-mode @key{RET}}).

Also see the documentation for the function @code{font-lock-mode},
available by typing @kbd{C-h f font-lock-mode} (@kbd{M-x
describe-function @key{RET} font-lock-mode @key{RET}}).

For more information on font-lock mode, take a look at the
@code{font-lock-mode} FAQ, maintained by
@email{jari.aalto@@ntc.nokia.com, Jari Aalto} at

@uref{ftp://cs.uta.fi/pub/ssjaaa/ema-font.gui}

To print buffers with the faces (i.e., colors and fonts) intact, use
@kbd{M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces} or @kbd{M-x

@cindex Very large files, opening
@cindex Large files, opening
@cindex Opening very large files
@cindex Maximum file size
@cindex Files, maximum size

Old versions (i.e., anything before 19.29) of Emacs had problems editing
files larger than 8 megabytes.  As of version 19.29, the maximum buffer
size is at least 2^27-1, or 134,217,727 bytes.

If you are using an older version of Emacs and cannot upgrade, you will
have to recompile. @email{lnz@@lucid.com, Leonard N. Zubkoff} suggests
putting the following two lines in @file{src/config.h} before compiling
Emacs to allow for 26-bit integers and pointers (and thus file sizes of
up to 33,554,431 bytes):

@example
#define VALBITS 26
#define GCTYPEBITS 5
@end example

This method may result in "ILLEGAL DATATYPE" and other random errors on
some machines.

@email{daveg@@csvax.cs.caltech.edu, David Gillespie} explains how this
problems crops up; while his numbers are true only for pre-19.29
versions of Emacs, the theory remains the same with current versions.

@quotation
Emacs is largely written in a dialect of Lisp; Lisp is a freely-typed
language in the sense that you can put any value of any type into any
variable, or return it from a function, and so on.  So each value
must carry a "tag" along with it identifying what kind of thing it is,
e.g., integer, pointer to a list, pointer to an editing buffer, and so
on.  Emacs uses standard 32-bit integers for data objects, taking the
top 8 bits for the tag and the bottom 24 bits for the value.  So
integers (and pointers) are somewhat restricted compared to true C
integers and pointers.

@node ^M in the shell buffer, Shell process exits abnormally, Problems with very large files, Bugs and problems
@section How do I get rid of @samp{^M} or echoed commands in my shell buffer?
@cindex Shell buffer, echoed commands and @samp{^M} in
@cindex Echoed commands in @code{shell-mode}

Try typing @kbd{M-x shell-strip-ctrl-m @key{RET}} while in @code{shell-mode} to
make them go away.  If that doesn't work, you have several options:

For tcsh, put this in your @file{.cshrc} (or @file{.tcshrc}) file:

@example
if ($?EMACS) then
    if ("$EMACS" == t) then
        if ($?tcsh) unset edit
        stty nl
    endif
endif
@end example

Or put this in your @file{.emacs_tcsh} file:

@example
unset edit
stty nl
@end example

Alternatively, use @file{csh} in your shell buffers instead of
@file{tcsh}.  One way is:

@lisp
(setq explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/csh")
@end lisp

and another is to do this in your @file{.cshrc} (or @file{.tcshrc})
file:

@example
setenv ESHELL /bin/csh
@end example

(You must start Emacs over again with the environment variable properly
set for this to take effect.)

You can also set the @code{ESHELL} environment variable in Emacs Lisp
with the following Lisp form,

@lisp
(setenv "ESHELL" "/bin/csh")
@end lisp

On a related note: If your shell is echoing your input line in the shell
buffer, you might want to try the following command in your shell
start-up file:

@example
stty -icrnl -onlcr -echo susp ^Z
@end example

@node Shell process exits abnormally, Termcap/Terminfo entries for Emacs, ^M in the shell buffer, Bugs and problems
@section Why do I get "Process shell exited abnormally with code 1"?
@cindex Abnormal exits from @code{shell-mode}
@cindex @code{shell-mode} exits

The most likely reason for this message is that the @samp{env} program
is not properly installed.  Compile this program for your architecture,
and install it with @samp{a+x} permission in the architecture-dependent
Emacs program directory.  (You can find what this directory is at your
site by inspecting the value of the variable @code{exec-directory} by
typing @kbd{C-h v exec-directory @key{RET}}.)

You should also check for other programs named @samp{env} in your path
(e.g., SunOS has a program named @file{/usr/bin/env}).  We don't
understand why this can cause a failure and don't know a general
solution for working around the problem in this case.

The @samp{make clean} command will remove @samp{env} and other vital
programs, so be careful when using it.

It has been reported that this sometimes happened when Emacs was started
as an X client from an xterm window (i.e., had a controlling tty) but the
xterm was later terminated.

See also @samp{PROBLEMS} (in the top-level directory when you unpack the
Emacs source) for other possible causes of this message.

@section Where is the termcap/terminfo entry for terminal type "emacs"?
@cindex Termcap
@cindex Terminfo
@cindex Emacs entries for termcap/terminfo

The termcap entry for terminal type @samp{emacs} is ordinarily put in
the @samp{TERMCAP} environment variable of subshells.  It may help in
certain situations (e.g., using rlogin from shell buffer) to add an
entry for @samp{emacs} to the system-wide termcap file.  Here is a
correct termcap entry for @samp{emacs}:

@example
emacs:tc=unknown:
@end example

To make a terminfo entry for "emacs", use "tic" or "captoinfo."  You need
to generate @file{/usr/lib/terminfo/e/emacs}.  It may work to simply copy
@file{/usr/lib/terminfo/d/dumb} to @file{/usr/lib/terminfo/e/emac}s.

Having a termcap/terminfo entry will not enable the use of full screen
programs in shell buffers.  Use @kbd{M-x terminal-emulator} for that
instead.

A workaround to the problem of missing termcap/terminfo entries is to
change terminal type "emacs" to type "dumb" or "unknown" in your shell
start up file.  "csh" users could put this in their .cshrc files:

@example
if ("$term" == emacs) set term=dumb
@end example

Your terminal (or something between your terminal and the computer) is
sending @kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-q} for flow control, and Emacs is receiving
these characters and interpreting them as commands.  (The @kbd{C-s}
character normally invokes the @code{isearch-forward} command.)  For
possible solutions, @pxref{Handling C-s and C-q with flow control}.

@section Why can't Emacs talk to certain hosts (or certain hostnames)?
@cindex Hosts, Emacs cannot talk to
@cindex @code{gethostbyname}, problematic version

The problem may be that Emacs is linked with a wimpier version of
@code{gethostbyname} than the rest of the programs on the machine.  This
is often manifested as a message on startup of "X server not responding.
Check your @samp{DISPLAY} environment variable." or a message of
"Unknown host" from @code{open-network-stream}.

On a Sun, this may be because Emacs had to be linked with the static C
library.  The version of @code{gethostbyname} in the static C library
may only look in @file{/etc/hosts} and the NIS (YP) maps, while the
version in the dynamic C library may be smart enough to check DNS in
addition to or instead of NIS.  On a Motorola Delta running System V
R3.6, the version of @code{gethostbyname} in the standard library works,
but the one that works with NIS doesn't (the one you get with -linet).
Other operating systems have similar problems.

Try these options:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Explicitly add the host you want to communicate with to @file{/etc/hosts}.

@item
Relink Emacs with this line in @file{src/config.h}:

@example
#define LIBS_SYSTEM -lresolv
@end example

@item
Replace @code{gethostbyname} and friends in @file{libc.a} with more
useful versions such as the ones in @file{libresolv.a}.  Then relink
Emacs.

@item
If you are actually running NIS, make sure that "ypbind" is properly
told to do DNS lookups with the correct command line switch.

Old versions of Emacs (i.e., versions before Emacs 20.x) often

@email{meuer@@geom.umn.edu, Mark Meuer} says that NeXT NFS has a bug

Emacs has no way of knowing when the shell actually changes its

guess by recognizing @samp{cd} commands.  If you type "cd" followed by a
directory name with a variable reference (@samp{cd $HOME/bin}) or with a
shell metacharacter (@samp{cd ../lib*}), Emacs will fail to correctly
guess the shell's new current directory.  A huge variety of fixes and
enhancements to shell mode for this problem have been written to handle
this problem.  Check the Lisp Code Directory (@pxref{Finding a package

@itemize @bullet

@item The @file{movemail} incident (No, this is not a risk.)

In his book @emph{The Cuckoo's Egg}, Cliff Stoll describes this in
chapter 4.  The site at LBL had installed the @file{etc/movemail}
program setuid root.  (As of version 19, @file{movemail} is in your
architecture-specific directory; type @kbd{C-h v exec-directory
@key{RET}} to see what it is.)  Since @file{movemail} had not been
designed for this situation, a security hole was created and users could
get root privileges.

@file{movemail} has since been changed so that this security hole will
not exist, even if it is installed setuid root.  However,
@file{movemail} no longer needs to be installed setuid root, which
should eliminate this particular risk.

We have heard unverified reports that the 1988 Internet worm took
advantage of this configuration problem.

@item The @code{file-local-variable} feature (Yes, a risk, but easy to change.)

There is an Emacs feature that allows the setting of local values for
variables when editing a file by including specially formatted text near
the end of the file.  This feature also includes the ability to have
arbitrary Emacs Lisp code evaluated when the file is visited.
Obviously, there is a potential for Trojan horses to exploit this
feature.

Emacs 18 allowed this feature by default; users could disable it by
setting the variable @code{inhibit-local-variables} to a non-nil value.

As of Emacs 19, Emacs has a list of local variables that create a
security risk.  If a file tries to set one of them, it asks the user to
confirm whether the variables should be set.  You can also tell Emacs
whether to allow the evaluation of Emacs Lisp code found at the bottom
of files by setting the variable @code{enable-local-eval}.

For more information, @inforef{File Variables, File Variables, emacs}.

@item Synthetic X events (Yes, a risk; use @samp{MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1} or better.)

Emacs accepts synthetic X events generated by the SendEvent request as
though they were regular events.  As a result, if you are using the
trivial host-based authentication, other users who can open X
connections to your X workstation can make your Emacs process do
anything, including run other processes with your privileges.

The only fix for this is to prevent other users from being able to open
X connections.  The standard way to prevent this is to use a real
authentication mechanism, such as @samp{MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1}.  If using
the @file{xauth} program has any effect, then you are probably using
@samp{MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1}.  Your site may be using a superior
authentication method; ask your system administrator.

If real authentication is not a possibility, you may be satisfied by
just allowing hosts access for brief intervals while you start your X
programs, then removing the access.  This reduces the risk somewhat by
narrowing the time window when hostile users would have access, but
@emph{does not eliminate the risk}.

On most computers running Unix and X Windows, you enable and disable
access using the @file{xhost} command.  To allow all hosts access to
your X server, use

@example
xhost +
@end example

at the shell prompt, which (on an HP machine, at least) produces the
following message:

@example
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
@end example

To deny all hosts access to your X server (except those explicitly
allowed by name), use

@example
xhost -
@end example

On the test HP computer, this command generated the following message:

@example
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
@end example

@node Dired claims that no file is on this line,  , Security risks with Emacs, Bugs and problems
@section Dired says, "no file on this line" when I try to do something.

Chances are you're using a localized version of Unix that doesn't use US
date format in dired listings.  You can check this by looking at dired
listings or by typing @code{ls -l} to a shell and looking at the dates that
come out.

Dired uses a regular expression to find the beginning of a file name.
In a long Unix-style directory listing ("ls -l"), the file name starts
after the date.  The regexp has thus been written to look for the date,
the format of which can vary on non-US systems.

There are two approaches to solving this.  The first one involves
setting things up so that "ls -l" outputs US date format.  This can be
done by setting the locale.  See your OS manual for more information.

The second approach involves changing the regular expression used by
dired, @code{dired-move-to-filename-regexp}.

instance, when Emacs 21 is released, it will most probably be
available at

@uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-21.1.tar.gz}

Again, you should use one of the GNU mirror sites (@xref{Current GNU
distributions}, and adjust the URL accordingly) so as to reduce load on
@file{ftp.gnu.org}.

@item
@code{gzip}, the GNU compression utility.  You can get @code{gzip} via
anonymous ftp at mirrors of @file{ftp.gnu.org} sites; it should compile
and install without much trouble on most systems.  Once you have
retrieved the Emacs sources, you will probably be able to uncompress
them with the command

@example
gunzip --verbose emacs-20.5.tar.gz
@end example

changing the Emacs version (20.5), as necessary.  Once gunzip has
finished doing its job, a file by the name of "emacs-20.5.tar" should
be in your build directory.

@item 
@file{tar}, the "tape archiving" program, which moves multiple files
into and out of archive files, or "tarfiles."  All of the files
comprising the Emacs source come in a single tarfile, and must be
extracted using @file{tar} before you can build Emacs.  Typically, the
extraction command would look like

@example
tar -xvvf emacs-20.5.tar
@end example

The @samp{x} indicates that we want to extract files from this tarfile,
the two @samp{v}s force verbose output, and the @samp{f} tells
@file{tar} to use a disk file, rather than one on tape.

If you're using GNU @file{tar} (available at mirrors of
@file{ftp.gnu.org}), you can combine this step and the previous one by
using the command

@example
tar -zxvvf emacs-20.5.tar.gz
@end example

The additional @samp{z} at the beginning of the options list tells GNU tar
to uncompress the file with gunzip before extracting the tarfile's
components.

@end itemize

At this point, the Emacs sources (all 25+ megabytes of them) should be
sitting in a directory called @file{emacs-20.5}.  On most common Unix and
Unix-like systems, you should be able to compile Emacs (with X Windows
support) with the following commands:

@example
cd emacs-20.5       # change directory to emacs-20.5
./configure         # configure Emacs for your particular system 
make                # use Makefile to build components, then Emacs 
@end example

If the @code{make} completes successfully, the odds are fairly good that
the build has gone well.  (@pxref{Problems building Emacs} if you weren't
successful.)

By default, Emacs is installed in the following directories:

@table @file

@item /usr/local/bin
binaries

@item /usr/local/share/emacs/20.xx
Lisp code and support files

@item /usr/local/info
Info documentation

@end table

To install files in those default directories, become the superuser and
type

@example
make install
@end example

Note that @code{make install} will overwrite @file{/usr/local/bin/emacs}
and any Emacs Info files that might be in @file{/usr/local/info}.

Much more verbose instructions (with many more hints and suggestions)
come with the Emacs sources, in the file @file{INSTALL}.

@node Updating Emacs, Problems building Emacs, Installing Emacs, Compiling and installing Emacs
@section How do I update Emacs to the latest version?
@cindex Updating Emacs

@xref{Installing Emacs}, and follow the instructions there for
installation.

Most files are placed in version-specific directories.  Emacs 20.5, for
instance, places files in @file{/usr/local/share/emacs/20.5}.

Upgrading should overwrite only, @file{/usr/local/bin/emacs} (the Emacs
binary) and documentation in @file{/usr/local/info}.  Back up these
files before you upgrade, and you shouldn't have too much trouble.

@node Linking with -lX11 fails,  , Problems building Emacs, Compiling and installing Emacs
@section Why does linking Emacs with -lX11 fail?
@cindex Linking with -lX11 fails
@cindex lX11, linking fails with

Emacs needs to be linked with the static version of the X11 library,
@file{libX11.a}.  This may be missing.

Under OpenWindows, you may need to use "add_services" to add the
"OpenWindows Programmers" optional software category from the CD-ROM.

Under HP-UX 8.0, you may need to run "update" again to load the X11-PRG
"fileset".  This may be missing even if you specified "all filesets" the
first time.  If @file{libcurses.a} is missing, you may need to load the
"Berkeley Development Option."

@email{zoo@@armadillo.com, David Zuhn} says that MIT X builds shared
libraries by default, and only shared libraries, on those platforms that
support them.  These shared libraries can't be used when undumping
temacs (the last stage of the Emacs build process).  To get regular
libraries in addition to shared libraries, add this to @file{site.cf}:

@example
#define ForceNormalLib YES
@end example

Other systems may have similar problems.  You can always define
CANNOT_DUMP and link with the shared libraries instead.

To get the Xmenu stuff to work, you need to find a copy of MIT's
@file{liboldX.a}.

@cindex Finding an Emacs Lisp package
@cindex Functionality, finding a particular package 

First of all, you should check to make sure that the package isn't
already available.  For example, typing @kbd{M-x apropos @key{RET}
wordstar @key{RET}} lists all functions and variables containing the
string @samp{wordstar}.

It is also possible that the package is on your system, but has not been
loaded.  To see which packages are available for loading, look through
your computer's lisp directory (@pxref{Filename conventions}).  The Lisp
source to most most packages contains a short description of how they
should be loaded, invoked, and configured --- so before you use or
modify a Lisp package, see if the author has provided any hints in the
source code.

If a package does not come with Emacs, check the Lisp Code Directory.
The LCD was originally maintained by @email{brennan@@hal.com, Dave
Brennan}, but was recently taken over by @email{toby@@world.std.com,
toby knudsen}, who maintains @uref{http://www.emacs.org}.  The LCD is
currently being reorganized and updated, but you can meanwhile find many
packages at @uref{ftp://ftp.emacs.org/pub}.

For now, you can search through the LCD with @file{lispdir.el}, which is
in the process of being updated.  Download it from the LCD, in the
@file{emacs-lisp-attic/misc} directory, and then evaluate the following
Lisp form (@pxref{Evaluating Emacs Lisp code}):

@lisp
(setq lisp-code-directory
 "/anonymous@@ftp.emacs.org:pub/emacs-lisp-attic/emacs-lisp/LCD-datafile.gz"
  elisp-archive-host "ftp.emacs.org"
  elisp-archive-directory "/pub/emacs-lisp-attic/emacs-lisp/")
@end lisp

Once you have installed @file{lispdir.el}, you can use @kbd{M-x
lisp-dir-apropos} to search the listing.  For example, @kbd{M-x
lisp-dir-apropos @key{RET} ange-ftp @key{RET}} produces this output:

@section What is the difference between Emacs and XEmacs (formerly "Lucid Emacs")?
@cindex XEmacs
@cindex Difference Emacs and XEmacs
@cindex Lucid Emacs
@cindex Epoch

First of all, they're both GNU Emacs.  XEmacs is just as much a later
version of GNU Emacs as the FSF-distributed version.  This FAQ refers to
the latest version to be distributed by the FSF as "Emacs," partly
because the XEmacs maintainers now refer to their product using the
"XEmacs" name, and partly because there isn't any accurate way to
differentiate between the two without getting mired in paragraphs of
legalese and history.

XEmacs, which began life as Lucid Emacs, is based on an early version of
Emacs 19 and Epoch, an X-aware version of Emacs 18.

Emacs (i.e., the version distributed by the FSF) has a larger installed
base and now always contains the MULE multilingual facilities.
XEmacs can do some clever tricks with X Windows, such as
putting arbitrary graphics in a buffer.  Similar facilities have been
implemented for Emacs as part of a new redisplay implementation for
Emacs 21, expected to be released after Emacs 20.5.
Emacs and XEmacs each come with
Lisp packages that are lacking in the other; RMS says that the FSF would
include more packages that come with XEmacs, but that the XEmacs
maintainers don't always keep track of the authors of contributed code,
which makes it impossible for the FSF to have certain legal papers
signed.  (Without these legal papers, the FSF will not distribute Lisp
packages with Emacs.)  The two versions have some
significant differences at the Lisp programming level.

Many XEmacs features have found their way into recent versions of Emacs,
and more features can be expected in the future, but there are still many
differences between the two.

@cindex Tools needed to compile Emacs under DOS

A pre-built binary distribution of Emacs is available from the Simtel
archives.  This version apparently works under MS-DOS and Windows (3.x,
95x, and NT) and supports long file names under Windows 9x.  More
information is available from

@uref{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/emacs.README}

The binary itself is available in the files em1934*.zip in the
directory

@uref{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/}

If you prefer to compile Emacs for yourself, you can do so with the
current distribution directly.  You will need a 386 (or
better) processor, and to be running MS-DOS 3.0 or later.  According to
@email{eliz@@is.elta.co.il, Eli Zaretskii} and
@email{hankedr@@dms.auburn.edu, Darrel Hankerson}, you will need the
following:

@table @emph

@item Compiler
djgpp version 1.12 maint 1 or later.  Djgpp 2.0 or later is
recommended, since 1.x is being phased out.  Djgpp 2 supports
long filenames under Windows 9x.

You can get the latest release of djgpp by retrieving all of
the files in

@uref{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp}

@item Gunzip and tar
The easiest way is to use "djtar" which comes with djgpp v2.x,
because it can open gzip'ed tarfiles (i.e., those ending with
".tar.gz") in one step.  Djtar comes in "djdev201.zip", from
the URL mentioned above.

@item make, mv, sed, and rm
All of these utilities are available at

@uref{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu}

16-bit utilities can be found in GNUish, at

@uref{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/gnuish}

The files @file{INSTALL} and @file{PROBLEMS} in the top-level directory
of the Emacs source contains some additional information regarding Emacs
under MS-DOS.

look-alikes), consult the list of "Emacs implementations and literature,"

Since Emacs 19.29, the preferred vi emulation in Emacs is VIPER
(@kbd{M-x viper-mode @key{RET}}), which comes with Emacs.  It extends
and supersedes VIP (including VIP 4.3) and provides vi emulation at
several levels, from one that closely follows vi to one that departs
from vi in several significant ways.

For Emacs 19.28 and earlier, the following version of VIP is generally
better than the one distributed with Emacs:

@section How do I bind keys (including function keys) to commands?
@cindex Binding keys to commands
@cindex Keys, binding to commands
@cindex Commands, binding keys to

Keys can be bound to commands either interactively or in your
@file{.emacs} file.  To interactively bind keys for all modes, type
@kbd{M-x global-set-key @key{RET} KEY CMD @key{RET}}.

To bind a key just in the current major mode, type @kbd{M-x local-set-key @key{RET} KEY CMD @key{RET}}.

See @inforef{Key Bindings, Key Bindings, emacs} for further details.

To bind keys on starting Emacs or on starting any given mode, use the
following "trick": First bind the key interactively, then immediately
type @kbd{C-x @key{ESC} @key{ESC} C-a C-k C-g}.  Now, the command needed
to bind the key is in the kill ring, and can be yanked into your
@file{.emacs} file.  If the key binding is global, no changes to the
command are required.  For example,

@lisp
(global-set-key (quote [f1]) (quote help-for-help))
@end lisp

can be placed directly into the @file{.emacs} file.  If the key binding is
local, the command is used in conjunction with the "add-hook" command.
For example, in tex-mode, a local binding might be

@lisp
(add-hook 'tex-mode-hook
  (function (lambda ()
    (local-set-key (quote [f1]) (quote help-for-help)))))
@end lisp


@itemize @bullet

@item Control characters in key sequences, in the form yanked from the
kill ring are given in their graphic form --- i.e., @key{CTRL} is shown
as @samp{^}, @key{TAB} as a set of spaces (usually 8), etc.  You may
want to convert these into their vector or string forms.

@item If a prefix key of the character sequence to be bound is already
bound as a complete key, then you must unbind it before the new
binding.  For example, if "ESC @{" is previously bound:

@lisp
(global-unset-key [?\e ?@{])   ;;   or
(local-unset-key [?\e ?@{])
@end lisp

@item Aside from commands and "lambda lists," a vector or string also
can be bound to a key and thus treated as a macro.  For example:

@lisp
(global-set-key [f10] [?\C-x?\e?\e?\C-a?\C-k?\C-g])  ;;  or
(global-set-key [f10] "\C-x\e\e\C-a\C-k\C-g")

@section Why does Emacs say "Key sequence XXX uses invalid prefix characters"?
@cindex Prefix characters, invalid
@cindex Invalid prefix characters
@cindex Misspecified key sequences

Usually, one of two things has happened.  In one case, the control
character in the key sequence has been misspecified (e.g. @samp{C-f}
used instead of @samp{\C-f} within a Lisp expression).  In the other
case, a "prefix key" in the keystroke sequence you were trying to bind
was already bound as a "complete key."  Historically, the @samp{ESC [}
prefix was usually the problem, in which case you should evaluate either
of these forms before attempting to bind the key sequence:

@lisp
(global-unset-key [?\e ?[])  ;;  or
(global-unset-key "\e[")
@end lisp

@node Terminal setup code works after Emacs has begun, Using function keys under X, Invalid prefix characters, Key bindings
@section Why doesn't this [terminal or window-system setup] code work in my @file{.emacs} file, but it works just fine after Emacs starts up?
@cindex Terminal setup code in @file{.emacs}

During startup, Emacs initializes itself according to a given code/file
order.  If some of the code executed in your @file{.emacs} file needs to
be postponed until the initial terminal or window-system setup code has
been executed but is not, then you will experience this problem (this
code/file execution order is not enforced after startup).

To postpone the execution of Emacs Lisp code until after terminal or
window-system setup, treat the code as a "lambda list" and set the value
of either the @code{term-setup-hook} or @code{window-setup-hook}
variable to this "lambda function."  For example,

@lisp
(setq term-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (cond ((string-match "\\`vt220" (or (getenv "TERM") ""))
                ;; Make vt220's "Do" key behave like M-x:
                (global-set-key [do] 'execute-extended-command))
               ))))

@section How do I set the X key "translations" for Emacs?
@cindex X key translations

@cindex Translations for keys under X

Emacs is not written using the Xt library by default, so there are no
"translations" to be set.  (We aren't sure how to set such translations
if you do build Emacs with Xt; please let us know if you've done this!)

The only way to affect the behavior of keys within Emacs is through
"xmodmap" (outside Emacs) or @code{define-key} (inside Emacs).  The
@code{define-key} command should be used in conjunction with the
@code{function-key-map} map.  For instance,

@lisp
(define-key function-key-map [M-@key{TAB}] [?\M-\t])
@end lisp

defines the @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} key sequence.

@node Handling C-s and C-q with flow control, Binding C-s and C-q, X key translations for Emacs, Key bindings

@cindex Flow control, @kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-q} with
@cindex @kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-q} with flow control

@kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-q} are used in the XON/XOFF flow control protocol.
This messes things up when you're using Emacs, because Emacs binds these
keys to commands by default.  Because Emacs won't honor them as flow
control characters, too many of these characters are not passed on and
overwhelm output buffers.  Sometimes, intermediate software using
XON/XOFF flow control will prevent Emacs from ever seeing @kbd{C-s} and
@kbd{C-q}.

Possible solutions:

@itemize @bullet

@item Disable the use of @kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-q} for flow control.

You need to determine the cause of the flow control.

@itemize @minus

@item your terminal

Your terminal may use XON/XOFF flow control to have time to display
all the characters it receives.  For example, VT series terminals do
this.  It may be possible to turn this off from a setup menu.  For
example, on a VT220 you may select "No XOFF" in the setup menu.  This
is also true for some terminal emulation programs on PCs.

When you turn off flow control at the terminal, you will also need to
turn it off at the other end, which might be at the computer you are
logged in to or at some terminal server in between.

If you turn off flow control, characters may be lost; using a printer
connected to the terminal may fail.  You may be able to get around
this problem by modifying the "termcap" entry for your terminal to
include extra NUL padding characters.

@item a modem

If you are using a dialup connection, the modems may be using
XON/XOFF flow control.  It's not clear how to get around this.

@item a router or terminal server

Some network box between the terminal and your computer may be using
XON/XOFF flow control.  It may be possible to make it use some other
kind of flow control.  You will probably have to ask your local
network experts for help with this.

@item tty and/or pty devices

If your connection to Emacs goes through multiple tty and/or pty
devices, they may be using XON/XOFF flow control even when it is not
necessary.

@email{eirik@@theory.tn.cornell.edu, Eirik Fuller} writes:

@quotation
Some versions of "rlogin" (and possibly telnet) do not pass flow
control characters to the remote system to which they connect.  On
such systems, Emacs on the remote system cannot disable flow
control on the local system.  Sometimes "rlogin -8" will avoid this
problem.

One way to cure this is to disable flow control on the local host
(the one running rlogin, not the one running rlogind) using the
stty command, before starting the rlogin process.  On many systems,
@samp{stty start u stop u} will do this.

Some versions of @samp{tcsh} will prevent even this from working.  One
way around this is to start another shell before starting rlogin,
and issue the @samp{stty} command to disable flow control from that shell.
@end quotation

Use @samp{stty -ixon} instead of @samp{stty start u stop u} on some systems.

@end itemize

@item Make Emacs speak the XON/XOFF flow control protocol.

You can make Emacs treat @kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-q} as flow control characters by
evaluating the form

@lisp
(enable-flow-control)
@end lisp

to unconditionally enable flow control or

@lisp
(enable-flow-control-on "vt100" "h19")
@end lisp

(using your terminal names instead of @samp{vt100} or @samp{h19}) to
enable selectively.  These commands will automatically swap @kbd{C-s}
and @kbd{C-q} to @kbd{C-\} and @kbd{C-^}.  Variables can be used to
change the default swap keys (@code{flow-control-c-s-replacement} and
@code{flow-control-c-q-replacement}).

If you are fixing this for yourself, simply put the form in your
@file{.emacs} file.  If you are fixing this for your entire site, the
best place to put it is in the @file{lisp/site-start.el} file.  Putting
this form in @file{lisp/default.el} has the problem that if the user's
@file{.emacs} file has an error, this will prevent
@file{lisp/default.el} from being loaded and Emacs may be unusable for
the user, even for correcting their @file{.emacs} file (unless they're
smart enough to move it to another name).

@section Why does the @key{Backspace} key invoke help?
@cindex Backspace key invokes help
@cindex Help invoked by Backspace

The @key{Backspace} key (on most keyboards) generates ASCII code 8.
@kbd{C-h} sends the same code.  In Emacs by default @kbd{C-h} invokes
help-command.  This is intended to be easy to remember since the first
letter of @samp{help} is @samp{h}.  The easiest solution to this problem
is to use @kbd{C-h} (and @key{Backspace}) for help and @key{DEL} (the
@key{Delete} key) for deleting the previous character.

For many people this solution may be problematic:

@itemize @bullet

@item
They normally use @key{Backspace} outside of Emacs for deleting the
previous character.  This can be solved by making @key{DEL} the command
for deleting the previous character outside of Emacs.  On many Unix
systems, this command will remap @key{DEL}:

@example
stty erase `^?'
@end example

@item
The person may prefer using the @key{Backspace} key for deleting the
previous character because it is more conveniently located on their
keyboard or because they don't even have a separate Delete key.  In
this case, the @key{Backspace} key should be made to behave like
@key{Delete}.  There are several methods.

@item
Some terminals (e.g., VT3## terminals) allow the character generated
by the @key{Backspace} key to be changed from a setup menu.

@item
You may be able to get a keyboard that is completely programmable.

@item
Under X or on a dumb terminal, it is possible to swap the
@key{Backspace} and @key{Delete} keys inside Emacs:

@lisp
(keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)
@end lisp

@xref{Swapping keys}, for further details of "keyboard-translate".

@item
Another approach is to switch key bindings and put help on @kbd{C-x h}
instead:

@lisp
(global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)

;;; overrides mark-whole-buffer
(global-set-key "\C-xh" 'help-command) 
@end lisp

Other popular key bindings for help are @kbd{M-?} and @kbd{C-x ?}.

Don't try to bind @key{DEL} to @code{help-command}, because there are
many modes that have local bindings of @key{DEL} that will interfere.

@section How do I swap two keys?
@cindex Swapping keys
@cindex Keys, swapping
@cindex @code{keyboard-translate}

In Emacs 19, you can swap two keys (or key sequences) by using the
@code{keyboard-translate} function.  For example, to turn @kbd{C-h} into
@key{DEL} and @key{DEL} to @kbd{C-h}, use

@lisp
(keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)  ; translate `C-h' to DEL
(keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-h)  ; translate DEL to `C-h'.
@end lisp

The first key sequence of the pair after the function identifies what is
produced by the keyboard; the second, what is matched for in the
keymaps.

Keyboard translations are not the same as key bindings in keymaps.
Emacs contains numerous keymaps that apply in different situations, but
there is only one set of keyboard translations, and it applies to every
character that Emacs reads from the terminal.  Keyboard translations
take place at the lowest level of input processing; the keys that are
looked up in keymaps contain the characters that result from keyboard
translation.

@cindex Binding modifiers and function keys

With Emacs 19 you can represent modified function keys in vector format
by adding prefixes to the function key symbol.  For example (from the
on-line documentation):

@lisp
(global-set-key [?\C-x right] 'forward-page)
@end lisp

where @samp{?\C-x} is the Lisp character constant for the character @kbd{C-x}.

You can use the modifier keys @key{Control}, @key{Meta}, @key{Hyper},
@key{Super}, @key{Alt}, and @key{Shift} with function keys.  To
represent these modifiers, prepend the strings @samp{C-}, @samp{M-},
@samp{H-}, @samp{s-}, @samp{A-}, and @samp{S-} to the symbol name.  Here
is how to make @kbd{H-M-RIGHT} move forward a word:

@lisp

@end lisp

@item Not all modifiers are permitted in all situations.  @key{Hyper},

@kbd{mouse-1}) also fall under this category.

You may have big problems using @file{mwm} as your window manager.
(Does anyone know a good generic solution to allow the use of the
@key{Meta} key in Emacs with @file{mwm}?)

@item
For X11: Make sure it really is a @key{Meta} key.  Use @file{xev} to
find out what keysym your @key{Meta} key generates.  It should be either
@key{Meta}_L or @key{Meta}_R.  If it isn't, use @file{xmodmap} to fix
the situation.

@item
Make sure the pty the xterm is using is passing 8 bit characters.
@samp{stty -a} (or @samp{stty everything}) should show @samp{cs8} somewhere.
If it shows @samp{cs7} instead, use @samp{stty cs8 -istrip} (or @samp{stty
pass8}) to fix it.

@item
If there is an rlogin connection between the xterm and the Emacs, the
"-8" argument may need to be given to rlogin to make it pass all 8 bits
of every character.

@item
If the Emacs is running under Ultrix, it is reported that evaluating
@code{(set-input-mode t nil)} helps.

@item
If all else fails, you can make xterm generate @kbd{@key{ESC} W} when
you type @kbd{M-W}, which is the same conversion Emacs would make if it
got the @kbd{M-W} anyway.  In X11R4, the following resource
specification will do this:

@example
XTerm.VT100.EightBitInput: false
@end example

(This changes the behavior of the @code{insert-eight-bit} action.)

With older xterms, you can specify this behavior with a translation:

@example
XTerm.VT100.Translations: #override \
  Meta<KeyPress>: string(0x1b) insert()
@end example

You might have to replace @samp{Meta} with @samp{Alt}.

This is a result of an internationalization extension in X11R4 and the
fact that HP is now using this extension.  Emacs assumes that
XLookupString returns the same result regardless of the @key{Meta} key
state which is no longer necessarily true.  Until Emacs is fixed, the
temporary kludge is to run this command after each time the X server is
started but preferably before any xterm clients are:

@example
xmodmap -e 'remove mod1 = Mode_switch'
@end example

This will disable the use of the extra keysyms systemwide, which may be
undesirable if you actually intend to use them.

Emacs 19 has built-in support for eight-bit characters.  See
@inforef{European Display, European Display, emacs}, from which this
excerpt is taken:

@quotation
Some European languages use accented letters and other special symbols.
The ISO 8859 Latin-1 character set defines character codes for many
European languages in the range 160 to 255.

Emacs can display those characters according to Latin-1, provided the
terminal or font in use supports them.  The @kbd{M-x
standard-display-european} command toggles European character display
mode.  With a numeric argument, @kbd{M-x standard-display-european}
enables European character display if and only if the argument is
positive.

Some operating systems let you specify the language you are using by
setting a locale.  Emacs handles one common special case of this: if
your locale name for character types contains the string "8859-1" or
"88591", Emacs automatically enables European character display mode
when it starts up.

@inforef{European Display, European Display, emacs}, from which this is
taken:

@quotation
If you enter non-ASCII ISO Latin-1 characters often, you might find ISO
Accents mode convenient.  When this minor mode is enabled, @key{`},
@key{'}, @key{"}, @key{^}, @key{/} and @key{~} modify the following
letter by adding the corresponding diacritical mark to it, if possible.
To enable or disable ISO Accents mode, use the command @kbd{M-x
iso-accents-mode}.  This command affects only the current buffer.

To enter one of those six special characters, type the character,
followed by a space.  Some of those characters have a corresponding
"dead key" accent character in the ISO Latin-1 character set; to enter
that character, type the corresponding ASCII character twice.  For
example, @kbd{''} enters the Latin-1 character acute-accent (character
code 0264).

system's version of @file{/usr/ucb/mail} (aka mailx) supports RFC822
-- separate addresses with commas in your @file{~/.mailrc} file.

@item
Emacs normally only reads the @file{.mailrc} file once per session,

Note that the aliases are expanded automatically only after you type

There is a bug in NNTP version 1.5.10, such that when multiple requests

You can work around the bug inside Emacs like this:

You can find out what version of NNTP your news server is running by
telnetting to the NNTP port (usually 119) on the news server machine
(i.e., "telnet server-machine 119").  The server should give its version
number in the welcome message.  Type "quit" to get out.

The problem is almost always interaction between NNTP and C News.  NNTP
POST asks C News's inews to not background itself but rather hang around
and give its exit status so it knows whether the post was successful.
(That wait will on some systems not return the exit status of the
waited for job is a different sort of problem.)  It ends up taking a
long time because inews is calling relaynews, which often waits for
another relaynews to free the lock on the news system so it can file the
article.

My preferred solution is to change inews to not call relaynews, but
rather use newsspool.  This loses some error-catching functionality, but
is for the most part safe as inews will detect a lot of the errors on
its own.  The C News folks have sped up inews, too, so speed should look
better to most folks as that update propagates around.
