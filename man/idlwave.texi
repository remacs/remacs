@cindex Feature overview

IDLWAVE is a package to support editing command files for the
Interactive Data Language (IDL), and for running IDL as an inferior
shell.  It also can be used for WAVE/CL command files, but the support
for these is limited.  Note that this package has nothing to do with the
Interface Definition Language as part of the Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (CORBA).

IDLWAVE is the successor to the @file{idl.el} and @file{idl-shell.el}
files written by Chris Chase.  The modes and files had to be renamed
because of a name space conflict with CORBAs @code{idl-mode}, defined in
Emacs in the file @file{cc-mode.el}.  If you have been using the old
files, check @ref{Upgrading from idl.el} for information on how to
switch.

IDLWAVE consists of two parts: A major mode for editing command files
(@code{idlwave-mode}) and a mode to allow running the IDL program as an
inferior shell (@code{idlwave-shell-mode}).  Both modes work closely
together and form a complete development environment.

Here is a brief summary of what IDLWAVE does.

@cindex Tutorial
@cindex Getting Started

@section Lession I: Development Cycle

The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through a very basic
development cycle with IDLWAVE.  We will type a simple program into a
buffer and use the shell to compile, debug and run this program.  On the
way we will use the most important commands in IDLWAVE.  Note
however that there is much more funtionality available in IDLWAVE than
we cover here, and it will pay off greatly if eventually you go further
and read the whole manual.

I assume that you have access to Emacs or XEmacs with the full IDLWAVE
package including online help (@pxref{Installation}).  I also assume
that you are familiar with Emacs and can read the nomenclature of key
presses in Emacs (in particular, @kbd{C} stands for @key{CONTROL} and
@kbd{M} for @key{META} (often the @key{ALT} key carries this
functionality)).

Open a new source file by typing

@example
@kbd{C-x C-f tutorial.pro @key{RET}}
@end example

A buffer for this file will pop up, and it should be in IDLWAVE mode.
You can see this by looking at the mode line, just below the editing
window.  Also, the menu bar should contain entries @samp{IDLWAVE} and
@samp{Debug}.

Now cut-and-paste the following program, also available as
@file{tutorial.pro} in the IDLWAVE distribution.

@example
function daynr,d,m,y
  ;; compute a sequence number for a date
  ;; works 1901-2099.
  if y lt 100 then y = y+1900
  if m le 2 then delta = 1 else delta = 0
  m1 = m + delta*12 + 1
  y1 = y * delta
  return, d + floor(m1*30.6)+floor(y1*365.25)+5
end
     
function weekday,day,month,year
  ;; compute weekday number for date
  nr = daynr(day,month,year)
  return, nr mod 7
end
     
pro plot_wday,day,month
  ;; Plot the weekday of a date in the first 10 years of this century.
  years = 2000,+indgen(10)
  wdays = intarr(10)
  for i=0,n_elements(wdays)-1 do begin
     wdays[i] =  weekday(day,month,years[i])
  end
  plot,years,wdays,YS=2,YT="Wday (0=sunday)"
end
@end example

The indentation probably looks funny, since it's different from the
settings you use, so use the @key{TAB} key in each line to automatically
line it up (or more quickly @emph{select} the entire buffer with
@kbd{C-x h} followed by @kbd{C-M-\}).  Notice how different syntactical
elements are highlighted in different colors, if you have set up support
for font-lock.

Let's check out two particular editing features of IDLWAVE.  Place the
cursor after the @code{end} statement of the @code{for} loop and press
@key{SPC}.  IDLWAVE blinks back to the beginning of the block and
changes the generic @code{end} to the specific @code{endfor}
automatically.  Now place the cursor in any line you would like to split
into two and press @kbd{M-@key{RET}}.  The line is split at the cursor
position, with the continuation @samp{$} and indentation all taken care
of.  Use @kbd{C-/} to undo the last change.

The procedure @code{plot_wday} is supposed to plot the weekday of a given
date for the first 10 years of the 21st century.  I have put in a few
bugs which we are going to fix now.

First, let's launch the IDLWAVE shell.  You do this with the command
@kbd{C-c C-s}.  The Emacs window will split and display IDL running in a
shell interaction buffer.  Type a few commands like @code{print,!PI} to
convince yourself that you can work there like in an xterminal, or the
IDLDE.  Use the arrow keys to cycle through your command history.  Are
we having fun now?

Now go back to the source window and type @kbd{C-c C-d C-c} to compile
the program.  If you watch the shell buffer, you see that IDLWAVE types
@samp{.run tutorial.pro} for you.  But the compilation fails because
there is a comma in the line @samp{years=...}.  The line with the error
is highlighted and the cursor positioned at the error, so remove the
comma (you should only need to hit Delete!).  Compile again, using the
same keystrokes as before.  Notice that the file is saved for you.  This
time everything should work fine, and you should see the three routines
compile.

Now we want to use the command to plot the weekdays for January 1st.  We
could type the full command ourselves, but why do that?  Go back to the
shell window, type @samp{plot_} and hit @key{TAB}.  After a bit of a
delay (while IDLWAVE initializes its routine info database), the window
will split to show all procedures it knows starting with that string,
and @w{@code{plot_wday}} should be one of them.  Saving the buffer was
enough to tell IDLWAVE about this new routine.  Click with the middle
mouse button on @code{plot_wday} and it will be copied to the shell
buffer, or if you prefer, add @samp{w} to @samp{plot_} to make it
unambiguous, hit @key{TAB}, and the full routine name will be completed.
Now provide the two arguments:

@example
plot_wday,1,1
@end example


and press @key{RET}.  This fails with an error message telling you the
@code{YT} keyword to plot is ambiguous.  What are the allowed keywords
again?  Go back to the source window and put the cursor into the `plot'
line, and press @kbd{C-c ?}.  This pops up the routine info window for
the plot routine, which contains a list of keywords, and the argument
list.  Oh, we wanted @code{YTITLE}.  Fix that up.  Recompile with
@kbd{C-c C-d C-c}. Jump back into the shell with @kbd{C-c C-s}, press
the @key{UP} arrow to recall the previous command and execute again.

This time we get a plot, but it is pretty ugly -- the points are all
connected with a line.  Hmm, isn't there a way for @code{plot} to use
symbols instead?  What was that keyword?  Position the cursor on the
plot line after a comma (where you'd normally type a keyword), and hit
@kbd{M-@key{Tab}}.  A long list of plot's keywords appears.  Aha, there
it is, @code{PSYM}.  Middle click to insert it.  An @samp{=} sign is
included for you too.  Now what were the values of @code{PSYM} supposed
to be?  With the cursor on or after the keyword, press @kbd{M-?} for
online help (alternatively, you could have right clicked on the colored
keyword itself in the completion list).  The online help window will pop
up showing the documentation for the @code{PYSM} keyword.  Ok, let's use
diamonds=4.  Fix this, recompile (you know the command by now: @kbd{C-c
C-d C-c}, go back to the shell (if it's vanished, you know the command
to recall it by now: @kbd{C-c C-s}) and execute again.  Now things look
pretty good.

Lets try a different day - how about April fool's day?

@example
plot_wday,1,4
@end example

   Oops, this looks very wrong.  All April fool's days cannot be
Fridays!  We've got a bug in the program, perhaps in the @code{daynr}
function.  Lets put a breakpoint on the last line there.  Position the
cursor on the @samp{return, d+...} line and press @kbd{C-c C-d C-b}.
IDL sets a breakpoint (as you see in the shell window), and the line is
highlighted in some way.  Back to the shell buffer, re-execute the
previous command.  IDL stops at the line with the breakpoint.  Now hold
down the SHIFT key and click with the middle mouse button on a few
variables there: @samp{d}, @samp{y}, @samp{m}, @samp{y1}, etc.  Maybe
@code{d} isn't the correct type.  CONTROL-SHIFT middle-click on it for
help.  Well, it's an integer, so that's not the problem.  Aha, @samp{y1}
is zero, but it should be the year, depending on delta.  Shift click
@samp{delta} to see that it's 0.  Below, we see the offending line:
@samp{y1=y*delta...} the multiplication should have been a minus sign!
So fix the line to

@example
y1 = y - delta
@end example

Now remove all breakpoints: @kbd{C-c C-d C-a}.  Recompile and rerun the
command.  Everything should now work fine.  How about those leap years?
Change the code to plot 100 years and see that every 28 years, the
sequence of weekdays repeats.

@section Lession II: Customization

Emacs is probably the most customizable piece of software available, and
it would be a shame if you did not make use of this and adapt IDLWAVE to
your own preferences.  Customizing Emacs or IDLWAVE means that you have
to set Lisp variables in the @file{.emacs} file in your home directory.
This looks scary to many people because of all the parenthesis.
However, you can just cut and paste the examples given here and work
from there.

Lets first use a boolean variable.  These are variables which you turn
on or off, much like a checkbox. A value of @samp{t} means on, a
value of @samp{nil} means off.  Copy the following line into your
@file{.emacs} file, exit and restart Emacs.

@lisp
(setq idlwave-reserved-word-upcase t)
@end lisp

When this option is turned on, each reserved word you type into an IDL
source buffer will be converted to upper case when you press @key{SPC}
or @key{RET} right after the word.  Try it out!  @samp{if} changes to
@samp{IF}, @samp{begin} to @samp{BEGIN}.  If you don't like this
behavior, remove the option again from your @file{.emacs} file.

Now I bet you have your own indentation preferences for IDL code.  For
example, I like to indent the main block of an IDL program a bit,
different from the conventions used by RSI.  Also, I'd like to use only
3 spaces as indentation between @code{BEGIN} and @code{END}.  Try the
following lines in @file{.emacs}

@lisp
(setq idlwave-main-block-indent 2)
(setq idlwave-block-indent 3)
(setq idlwave-end-offset -3)
@end lisp

Restart Emacs, take the program we developed in the first part of this
tutorial and re-indent it with @kbd{C-c h} and @kbd{C-M-\}.  You
probably want to keep these lines in @file{.emacs}, with values adjusted
to your likings.  If you want to get more information about any of these
variables, type, e.g., @kbd{C-h v idlwave-main-block-indent @key{RET}}.
To find which variables can be customized, look for items marked
@samp{User Option:} in the manual.

If you cannot wrap your head around this Lisp stuff, there is another,
more user-friendly way to customize all the IDLWAVE variables.  You can
access it through the IDLWAVE menu in one of the @file{.pro} buffers,
option @code{Customize->Browse IDLWAVE Group}. Here you'll be presented
with all the various variables grouped into categories.  You can
navigate the hierarchy (e.g. Idlwave Code Formatting->Idlwave Main Block
Indent), read about the variables, change them, and `Save for Future
Sessions'.  Few of these variables need customization, but you can
exercise considerable control over IDLWAVE's functionality with them.

Many people I talk to find the key bindings used for the debugging
commands too long and complicated.  Do I always have to type @kbd{C-c
C-d C-c} to get a single simple command?  Due to Emacs rules and
conventions I cannot make better bindings by default, but you can.
First, there is a way to assign all debugging commands in a single sweep
to other combinations.  The only problem is that we have to use
something which Emacs does not need for other important commands.  A
good option is to execute debugging commands by holding down
@key{CONTROL} and @key{SHIFT} while pressing a single character:
@kbd{C-S-b} for setting a breakpoint, @kbd{C-S-c} for compiling the
current source file, @kbd{C-S-a} for deleting all breakpoints.  You can
have this with

@lisp
(setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(shift control))
@end lisp

If you have a special keyboard with for example a @key{HYPER} key, you
could use

@lisp
(setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(hyper))
@end lisp

instead to get compilation on @kbd{H-c}.

You can also assign specific commands to function keys.  This you must
do in the @emph{mode-hook}, a special function which is run when a new
buffer gets set up.  Keybindings can only be done when the buffer
exists.  The possibilities for key customization are endless.  Here we
set function keys f5-f8 to common debugging commands.

@lisp
;; First for the source buffer
(add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook
   (lambda ()
    (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
    (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
    (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
    (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
;; Then for the shell buffer
(add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
   (lambda ()
    (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
    (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
    (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
    (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
@end lisp

@section Lession III: Library Catalog

We have already used the routine info display in the first part of this
tutorial.  This was the key @kbd{C-c ?} which displays information about 
the IDL routine near the cursor position.  Wouldn't it be nice
to have the same available for your own library routines and for the
huge amount of code in major extension libraries like JHUPL or the
IDL-Astro library?  To do this, you must give IDLWAVE a chance to study
these routines first.  We call this @emph{Building the library catalog}.

From the IDLWAVE entry in the menu bar, select @code{Routine Info/Select
Catalog Directories}.  If necessary, start the shell first with @kbd{C-c
C-s} (@pxref{Starting the Shell}).  IDLWAVE will find out about the IDL
@code{!PATH} variable and offer a list of directories on the path.
Simply select them all (or whichever you want) and click on the
@samp{Scan&Save} button.  Then go for a cup of coffee while IDLWAVE
collects information for each and every IDL routine on your search path.
All this information is written to the file @file{.idlcat} in your home
directory and will from now one be automatically loaded whenever you use
IDLWAVE.  Try to use routine info (@kbd{C-c ?}) or completion
(@kbd{M-<TAB>}) while on any routine or partial routine name you know to
be located in the library.  E.g., if you have scanned the IDL-Astro
library:

@example
    a=readf@key{M-<TAB>}
@end example


expands to `readfits('.  Then try

@example
    a=readfits(@key{C-c ?}
@end example

and you get:

@example
Usage:    Result = READFITS(filename, header, heap)
...
@end example

I hope you made it until here.  Now you are set to work with IDLWAVE.
On the way you will want to change other things, and to learn more about
the possibilities not discussed in this short tutorial.  Read the
manual, look at the documentation strings of interesting variables (with
@kbd{C-h v idlwave<-variable-name> @key{RET}}) and ask the remaining
questions on @code{comp.lang.idl-pvwave}.

@cindex Indentation

Like all Emacs programming modes, IDLWAVE performs code indentation.
The @key{TAB} key indents the current line relative to context.
@key{LFD} insert a newline and indents the new line.  The indentation is 
governed by a number of variables.

@cindex Foreign code, adapting
@cindex Indentation, of foreign code
@kindex C-M-\
To re-indent a larger portion of code (e.g. when working with foreign code
written with different conventions), use @kbd{C-M-\}
(@code{indent-region}) after marking the relevant code.  Useful marking
commands are @kbd{C-x h} (the entire file) or @kbd{C-M-h} (the
current subprogram). @xref{Actions}, for information how to impose
additional formatting conventions on foreign code.

@defopt idlwave-main-block-indent (@code{0}) 
Extra indentation for the main block of code.  That is the block between
the FUNCTION/PRO statement and the END statement for that program
unit.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-block-indent (@code{5})
Extra indentation applied to block lines.  If you change this, you
probably also want to change @code{idlwave-end-offset}.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-end-offset (@code{-4})
Extra indentation applied to block END lines.  A value equal to negative
@code{idlwave-block-indent} will make END lines line up with the block
BEGIN lines.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-continuation-indent (@code{2})

In IDL, lines starting with a @samp{;} are called @emph{comment lines}.
Comment lines are indented as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .1 .90
@item @code{;;;}
@tab The indentation of lines starting with three semicolons remains
unchanged.
@item @code{;;}
@tab Lines starting with two semicolons are indented like the surrounding code.

@cindex Continuation lines
@cindex Line splitting
@cindex String splitting
@cindex Splitting, of lines

@kindex M-@key{RET}
In IDL, a newline character terminates a statement unless preceded by a
@samp{$}.  If you would like to start a continuation line, use
@kbd{M-@key{RET}} which calls the command @code{idlwave-split-line}.  It
inserts a @samp{$} to indicate that the following line is a continuation
of the current line, terminates the line with a newline and indents the
new line.  The command @kbd{M-@key{RET}} can also be used in the middle
of a line to split the line at that point.  When used inside a long
string constant, the string is split with the @samp{+} concatenation
operator.

@cindex Filling
@cindex @code{auto-fill-mode}
@cindex Hanging paragraphs
When filling comment paragraphs, IDLWAVE overloads the normal filling
functions and uses a function which creates hanging paragraphs as they
are customary in the IDL routine headers.  When @code{auto-fill-mode} is
turned on (toggle with @kbd{C-c C-a}), comments will be auto-filled.  If
the first line of a paragraph is matched by
@code{idlwave-hang-indent-regexp}, subsequent lines are indented to
after the position of this match, as in the following example.

@example
; INPUTS:
; x - an array containing
;     lots of interesting numbers.
;
; y - another variable where
;     a hanging paragraph is used
;     to describe it.
@end example

@kindex M-q
You also refill a comment paragraph with @kbd{M-q}.

@defopt idlwave-fill-comment-line-only (@code{t})
Non-@code{nil} means auto fill will only operate on comment lines.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-auto-fill-split-string (@code{t})
Non-@code{nil} means auto fill will split strings with the IDL @samp{+}
operator.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-split-line-string (@code{t})
Non-@code{nil} means @code{idlwave-split-line} will split strings with
@samp{+}.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-hanging-indent (@code{t})
Non-@code{nil} means comment paragraphs are indented under the hanging
indent given by @code{idlwave-hang-indent-regexp} match in the first
line of the paragraph.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-hang-indent-regexp
Regular expression matching the position of the hanging indent
in the first line of a comment paragraph.
@end defopt

@defopt idlwave-use-last-hang-indent (@code{nil})
Non-@code{nil} means use last match on line for
@code{idlwave-indent-regexp}.

@kindex C-c C-i
IDL defines more than one thousand procedures, functions and object
methods.  This large command set makes it difficult to remember the
calling sequence and keywords of a command.  IDLWAVE contains a list of
all builtin routines with calling sequences and keywords@footnote{This
list was created by scanning the IDL manual and might contain (very few)
errors.  Please report any detected errors to the maintainer, so that
they can be fixed.}.  It also scans Emacs buffers and library files for
routine definitions and queries the IDLWAVE-Shell for the properties of
modules currently compiled under the shell.  This information is updated
automatically.  If you think the information is not up-to-date, use
@kbd{C-c C-i} (@code{idlwave-update-routine-info}) to enforce a global
update.

@kindex C-c ?
To display the information about a routine, press @kbd{C-c ?} which
calls the command @code{idlwave-routine-info}.  When the current cursor
position is on the name or in the argument list of a procedure or
function, information will be displayed about the routine.  For example,
consider the cursor positions in the following line

@example
plot,x,alog(x+5*sin(x) + 2),
  1  2   3   4   5  6  7    8
@end example

@cindex Default routine, for info and help
On positions 1,2 and 8, information about the @samp{plot} procedure will
be shown.  On positions 3,4, and 7, the @samp{alog} function will be
described, while positions 5 and 6 will select the @samp{sin} function.
When you ask for routine information about an object method, and the
method exists in several classes, IDLWAVE queries for the class of the
object.

@cindex Calling sequences
@cindex Keywords of a routine
@cindex Routine source information
The description displayed contains the calling sequence, the list of
keywords and the source location of this routine.  It looks like this:

@example
Usage:    XMANAGER, NAME, ID
Keywords: BACKGROUND CATCH CLEANUP EVENT_HANDLER GROUP_LEADER
          JUST_REG MODAL NO_BLOCK
Source:   SystemLib   [CSB] /soft1/idl53/lib/xmanager.pro

@cindex IDL variable @code{!DIR}
@cindex @code{!DIR}, IDL variable

If a definition of this routine exists in several files accessible to
IDLWAVE, several @samp{Source} lines will point to the different files.
This may indicate that your routine is shadowing a library routine,
which may or may not be what you want (@pxref{Load-Path Shadows}).  The
information about the calling sequence and the keywords is derived from
the first source listed.  Library routines can only be supported if you
have scanned the local IDL library (@pxref{Library Catalog}).  The source
entry consists of a @emph{source category}, a set of @emph{flags} and
the path to the @emph{source file}.  The following categories
exist:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @i{System}
@tab A system routine, but we do not know if it is @i{Builtin} or
@i{SystemLib}.  When the system library has bee scanned
(@pxref{Library Catalog}), this category will automatically split into the
next two. 
@item @i{Builtin}
@tab A builtin routine with no source code available.
@item @i{SystemLib}
@tab A library routine in the official lib directory @file{!DIR/lib}.
@item @i{Obsolete}
@tab A library routine in the official lib directory @file{!DIR/lib/obsolete}.
@item @i{Library}
@tab A file on IDL's search path @code{!PATH}.
@item @i{Other}
@tab Any other file not known to be on the search path.
@item @i{Unresolved}
@tab The shell lists this routine as unresolved.
@end multitable

You can define additional categories based on the file name and path
with the variable @code{idlwave-special-lib-alist}.

@cindex Flags, in routine info
@cindex Duplicate routines
@cindex Multiply defined routines
@cindex Routine definitions, multiple
The flags @code{[CSB]} indicate if the file is known to IDLWAVE from the
library catalog (@w{@code{[C--]}}, @pxref{Library Catalog}), from the Shell
(@w{@code{[-S-]}}) or from an Emacs buffer (@w{@code{[--B]}}).
Combinations are possible.  If a file contains multiple definitions of
the same routine, the file name will be prefixed with @samp{(Nx)} where
@samp{N} is the number of definitions.

@item @i{Keyword}
@tab Online help about keywords is also available with the
@emph{right} mouse button.  Clicking on a keyword with the @emph{middle}
mouse button will insert this keyword in the buffer from where
@code{idlwave-routine-info} was called.  Holding down @key{SHIFT} while
clicking also adds the initial @samp{/}.
@item @i{Source}
@tab Clicking with the @emph{middle} mouse button on a @samp{Source} line
finds the source file of the routine and visits it in another window.
Another click on the same line switches back to the buffer from which
@kbd{C-c ?} was called.  If you use the @emph{right} mouse button, the
source will not be visited by a buffer, but displayed in the online help
window.

@cindex Speed, of online help
For IDL system routines, RSI provides extensive documentation.  IDLWAVE
can access an ASCII version of this documentation very quickly and
accurately.  This is @emph{much} faster than using the IDL online help
application, also because usually IDLWAVE gets you to the right place in
the docs directly, without additional browsing and scrolling.  For this
online help to work, you need an ASCII version of the IDL documentation
which is not part of the standard IDLWAVE distribution.  The required
files can be downloaded from @uref{@value{IDLWAVE-HOMEPAGE}, the
maintainers webpage}.  As the text is extracted from PDF files, the
formatting of the help text is good for normal text, but graphics and
multiline equations will not be well represented.  See also
@ref{Documentation Scan}.

@cindex Source code, as online help
@cindex DocLib header, as online help
For routines which are not documented in the IDL manual (for example
your own routines), the source code is used as help text.  If the
requested information can be found in a (more or less) standard DocLib
file header, IDLWAVE shows the header.  Otherwise the routine definition 
statement (@code{pro}/@code{function}) is shown.

@kindex M-?
In any IDL program, press @kbd{M-?} (@code{idlwave-context-help}) or

Note that the @code{OBJ_NEW} function is special in that the help
displayed depends on the cursor position: If the cursor is on the
@samp{OBJ_NEW}, this function is described.  If it is on the class name
inside the quotes, the documentation for the class is pulled up.  If the
cursor is @emph{after} the class name, anywhere in the argument list,
the documentation for the corresponding @code{Init} method and its

The completion function is context sensitive and figures out what to
complete at point.  Here are example lines and what @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}

@cindex Class ambiguity
@cindex @code{self} object, default class
An object method is not uniquely determined without the object's class.
Since the class part is usually omitted in the source code, IDLWAVE
considers all available methods in all classes as possible completions
of an object method name.  For keywords, the combined keywords of the
current method in all available classes will be considered.  In the
@file{*Completions*} buffer, the classes allowed for each completion
will be shown next to the item (see option
@code{idlwave-completion-show-classes}).  As a special case, the class
of an object called @samp{self} object is always the class of the
current routine.  All classes it inherits from are considered as well
where appropriate.

@cindex Forcing class query.
@cindex Class query, forcing
You can also call @code{idlwave-complete} with a prefix arg: @kbd{C-u
M-@key{TAB}}.  IDLWAVE will then prompt you for the class in order to
narrow down the number of possible completions.  The variable
@code{idlwave-query-class} can be configured to make this behavior the
default (not recommended).  After you have specified the class
for a particular statement (e.g. when completing the method), IDLWAVE
can remember it for the rest of the editing session.  Subsequent
completions in the same statement (e.g. keywords) can then reuse this
class information.  Remembering the class works by placing a text
property in the object operator @samp{->}.  This is not enabled by
default - the variable @code{idlwave-store-inquired-class} can be used
to turn it on.

@cindex Module source file
@cindex Source file, of a routine
@kindex C-c C-v
Apart from clicking on a @i{Source:} line in the routine info window,
there is also another way to find the source file of a routine.  The
command @kbd{C-c C-v} (@code{idlwave-find-module}) asks for a module
name, offering the same default as @code{idlwave-routine-info} would
have used.  In the minibuffer, specify a complete routine name
(including the class part).  IDLWAVE will display the source file in
another window.

@cindex Buffers, killing
@cindex Killing autoloaded buffers
Since getting the source of a routine into a buffer is so easy with
IDLWAVE, too many buffers visiting different IDL source files are
sometimes created.  The special command @kbd{C-c C-k}
(@code{idlwave-kill-autoloaded-buffers}) can be used to remove these
buffers.

@node Resolving Routines, Code Templates, Routine Source, The IDLWAVE Major Mode
@section Resolving Routines
@cindex @code{RESOLVE_ROUTINE}
@cindex Compiling library modules
@cindex Routines, resolving

The key sequence @kbd{C-c =} calls the command @code{idlwave-resolve}
and sends the line @samp{RESOLVE_ROUTINE, '@var{routine_name}'} to IDL
in order to resolve (compile) it.  The default routine to be resolved is
taken from context, but you get a chance to edit it.

@code{idlwave-resolve} is one way to get a library module within reach
of IDLWAVE's routine info collecting functions.  A better way is to
scan (parts of) the library (@pxref{Library Catalog}).  Routine info on
library modules will then be available without the need to compile the
modules first, and even without a running shell.

collects data about routines, and how to update this information.


@node Code Templates, Actions, Resolving Routines, The IDLWAVE Major Mode
@section Code Templates
@cindex Code templates
@cindex Abbreviations
@cindex Templates

IDLWAVE can insert IDL code templates into the buffer.  For a few
templates, this is done with direct key bindings:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @kbd{C-c C-c}
@tab @code{CASE} statement template
@item @kbd{C-c C-f}
@tab @code{FOR} loop template
@item @kbd{C-c C-r}
@tab @code{REPEAT} loop template
@item @kbd{C-c C-w}
@tab @code{WHILE} loop template
@end multitable

Otherwise, special abbreviations are used.  Emacs abbreviations are
expanded by typing text into the buffer and pressing @key{SPC} or
@key{RET}.  The special abbreviations used to insert code templates all
start with a @samp{\} (the backslash).  Here are a few examples of
predefined abbreviations.   For a full list, use @kbd{M-x
idlwave-list-abbrevs}.

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85

@tab @code{IF} statement template
@item @code{\elif}
@tab @code{IF-ELSE} statement template

@node Actions, Doc Header, Code Templates, The IDLWAVE Major Mode
@section Actions
@cindex Actions
@cindex Coding standards, enforcing

@emph{Actions} are special commands which are executed automatically
while you write code in order to check the structure of the program or
to enforce coding standards.  Most actions which have been implemented
in IDLWAVE are turned off by default, assuming that the average user
wants her code the way she writes it.  But if you are a lazy typist and
want your code to adhere to certain standards, they can be
helpful.

Action can be applied in three ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Some actions are applied directly while typing.  For example, pressing
@samp{=} can run a check to make sure that this operator is surrounded
by spaces and insert these spaces if necessary.  Pressing @key{SPC}
after a reserved word can call a command to change the word to upper
case.
@item
When a line is re-indented with @key{TAB}, actions can be applied to the
entire line.  To enable this, the variable @code{idlwave-do-actions}
must be non-@code{nil}.
@item
@cindex Foreign code, adapting
@cindex Actions, applied to foreign code
Action can also be applied to a larger piece of code, e.g. in order to
convert foreign code to your own style.  To do this, mark the relevant
part of the code and execute @kbd{M-x expand-region-abbrevs}.  Useful
marking commands are @kbd{C-x h} (the entire file) or @kbd{C-M-h} (the
current subprogram). @xref{Code Indentation}, for information how to
adjust the indentation of the code.
@end itemize

@defopt idlwave-do-actions (@code{nil})

corresponding start of the block and the cursor blinks back to that
location for a second.  If you have typed a specific @code{END}, like
@code{ENDIF} or @code{ENDCASE}, you get a warning if that kind of END
does not match the type of block it terminates.

Set the variable @code{idlwave-expand-generic-end} in order to have all

Some operators can be automatically surrounded by spaces.  This can
happen when the operator is typed, or also later when the line is
indented.  IDLWAVE contains this setting for the operators @samp{&},
@samp{<}, @samp{>}, @samp{,}, @samp{=}, and @samp{->}@footnote{Operators
longer than one character can only be padded during line indentation.},
but the feature is turned off by default.  If you want to turn it on,
customize the variables @code{idlwave-surround-by-blank} and
@code{idlwave-do-actions}.  You can also define similar actions for
other operators by using the function @code{idlwave-action-and-binding}
in the mode hook.  For example, to enforce space padding of the @samp{+}
and @samp{*} operators, try this in @file{.emacs}

@lisp

The IDLWAVE shell is an Emacs major mode which allows to run the IDL
program as an inferior process of Emacs.  It can be used to work with
IDL interactively, to compile and run IDL programs in Emacs buffers and
to debug these programs.  The IDLWAVE shell uses @file{comint}, an Emacs
packages which handles the communication with the IDL program.
Unfortunately IDL for Windows and MacOS does not allow the interaction
with Emacs@footnote{Please inform the maintainer if you come up with a way
to make the IDLWAVE shell work on these systems.}, so the IDLWAVE shell
only works under GNU and Unix.

The IDLWAVE shell can be started with the command @kbd{M-x
idlwave-shell}.  In @code{idlwave-mode} the function is bound to
@kbd{C-c C-s}.  It creates a buffer @file{*idl*} which is used to
interact with the shell.  If the shell is already running, @kbd{C-c C-s}
will simple switch to the shell buffer.  The command @kbd{C-c C-l}
(@code{idlwave-shell-recenter-shell-window}) displays the
shell window without selecting it.

In order to create a separate frame for the IDLWAVE shell buffer, call
@code{idlwave-shell} with a prefix argument: @kbd{C-u C-c C-s} or
@kbd{C-u C-c C-l}.  If you always want a dedicated frame for the shell
window, configure the variable
@code{idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame}. 

The shell can also be started automatically when another command tries

IDLWAVE works in line input mode: You compose a full command line, using
all the power Emacs gives you to do this.  When you press @key{RET}, the
whole line is sent to IDL.  Sometimes it is necessary to send single
characters (without a newline), for example when an IDL program is
waiting for single character input with the @code{GET_KBRD} function.
You can send a single character to IDL with the command @kbd{C-c C-x}
(@code{idlwave-shell-send-char}).  When you press @kbd{C-c C-y}
(@code{idlwave-shell-char-mode-loop}), IDLWAVE runs a blocking loop
which accepts characters and immediately sends them to IDL.  The loop
can be exited with @kbd{C-g}.  It terminates also automatically when the
current IDL command is finished.  Check the documentation of the two
variables described below for a way to make IDL programs trigger
automatic switches of the input mode.

@kindex C-c C-d
Programs can be compiled, run, and debugged directly from the source
buffer in Emacs.  The IDLWAVE shell installs key bindings both in the
shell buffer and in all IDL code buffers of the current Emacs session.
On Emacs versions which support this, it also installs a debugging
toolbar.  The display of the toolbar can be toggled with @kbd{C-c C-d
C-t} (@code{idlwave-shell-toggle-toolbar}).

The debugging key bindings are by default on the prefix key @kbd{C-c
C-d}, so for example setting a breakpoint is done with @kbd{C-c C-d
C-b}, compiling a source file with @kbd{C-c C-d C-c}.  If you find this
too much work you can choose a combination of modifier keys which is not
used by other commands.  For example, if you write in @file{.emacs}

@lisp
(setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(control shift))
@end lisp

a breakpoint can be set by pressing @kbd{b} while holding down
@kbd{shift} and @kbd{control} keys, i.e. @kbd{C-S-b}.  Compiling a
source file will be on @kbd{C-S-c}, deleting a breakpoint @kbd{C-S-d}
etc.  In the remainder of this chapter we will assume that the @kbd{C-c

You can set breakpoints and step through a program with IDLWAVE.
Setting a breakpoint in the current line of the source buffer is done
with @kbd{C-c C-d C-b} (@code{idlwave-shell-break-here}).  With a prefix
arg of 1, the breakpoint gets a @code{/ONCE} keyword, meaning that it
will be deleted after first use.  With a numeric prefix greater than
one, the breakpoint will only be active the @code{nth} time it is hit.
To clear the breakpoint in the current line, use @kbd{C-c C-d C-d}
(@code{idlwave-clear-current-bp}).  To clear all breakpoints, use
@kbd{C-c C-d C-a} (@code{idlwave-clear-all-bp}).  Breakpoint lines are
highlighted in the source code.

Once the program has stopped somewhere, you can step through it.  Here
is a summary of the breakpoint and stepping commands:

When execution is stopped you can examine the values of variables.  The

C-d ?} shows help on this expression.  The expression at point is an
array expression or a function call, or the contents of a pair of
parenthesis.  The selected expression becomes highlighted in the source
code for a short time.  Calling the above commands with a prefix
argument will prompt for an expression instead of using the one at
point.

It is very convenient to click with the mouse on expressions to retrieve
their value.  Expression printing is also bound to @kbd{S-Mouse-2} and
expression help to @kbd{C-S-Mouse-2}.  I.e. you need to hold down
@key{SHIFT} and @key{CONTROL} while clicking with the mouse.

Printing of expressions also works on higher levels of the calling

Use the commands @kbd{C-c C-d C-@key{UP}}
(@code{idlwave-shell-stack-up}) and @kbd{C-c C-d C-@key{DOWN}}
(@code{idlwave-shell-stack-down}) or the corresponding toolbar buttons

will indicate the routine and the calling stack level which define the
context for printing expressions.  The following restrictions apply for
all levels except the current:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Array expressions must use the @samp{[ ]} index delimiters.  Identifiers
with a @samp{( )} will be interpreted as function calls.
@item
@cindex ROUTINE_NAMES, IDL procedure
Printing values of expressions on higher levels of the calling stack
uses the @emph{unsupported} IDL routine @code{ROUTINE_NAMES}, which may
or may not be available in future versions of IDL.

Routines which can be used in an IDL program can be defined in several

@enumerate
@item 
@emph{Builtin routines} are defined inside IDL itself.  The source
code of such routines is not accessible to the user.
@item
Routines @emph{part of the current program} are defined in a file which
is explicitly compiled by the user.  This file may or may not be located
on the IDL search path.
@item 
@emph{Library routines} are defined in special files which are located
somewhere on IDL's search path.  When a library routine is called for
the first time, IDL will find the source file and compile it
dynamically.
@item
External routines written in other languages (like Fortran or C) can be
called with @code{CALL_EXTERNAL}, linked into IDL via @code{LINKIMAGE},
or included as dynamically loaded modules (DLMs).  Currently IDLWAVE
cannot provide routine info and completion for external
routines.

In oder to know about as many routines as possible, IDLWAVE will do the
following to collect information:

@enumerate

@item
It has a @emph{builtin list} with the properties of the builtin IDL
routines.  IDLWAVE @value{VERSION} is distributed with a list of
@value{NSYSROUTINES} routines and @value{NSYSKEYWORDS} keywords,
reflecting IDL version @value{IDLVERSION}.  This list has been created
by scanning the IDL manuals and is stored in the file
@file{idlw-rinfo.el}.  @xref{Documentation Scan}, for
information how to regenerate this file for new versions of IDL.

@item 
It @emph{scans} all @emph{buffers} of the current Emacs session for
routine definitions.  This is done automatically when routine
information or completion is first requested by the user.  Each new
buffer and each buffer which is saved after making changes is also
scanned. The command @kbd{C-c C-i} (@code{idlwave-update-routine-info})
can be used at any time to rescan all buffers.

@item
If you have an IDLWAVE-Shell running as inferior process of the current
Emacs session, IDLWAVE will @emph{query the shell} for compiled routines
and their arguments.  This happens automatically when routine
information or completion is first requested by the user, and each time
an Emacs buffer is compiled with @kbd{C-c C-d C-c}.  The command
@kbd{C-c C-i} (@code{idlwave-update-routine-info}) can be used to ask
the shell again at any time.

@item

file which will be automatically loaded just like

scan library files.

IDLWAVE can extract routine information from library modules and store
that information in a file.  To do this, the variable
@code{idlwave-libinfo-file} needs to contain the path to a file in an
existing directory (the default is @code{"~/.idlcat.el"}).  Since the
file will contain lisp code, its name should end in @file{.el}.  Under
Windows and MacOS, you also need to specify the search path for IDL
library files in the variable @code{idlwave-library-path}, and the
location of the IDL directory (the value of the @code{!DIR} system
variable) in the variable @code{idlwave-system-directory}.  Under Unix and GNU,
these values will be automatically inferred from an IDLWAVE
shell.

The command @kbd{M-x idlwave-create-libinfo-file} can then be used to
scan library files.  It brings up a widget in which you can select some
or all directories on the search path.  If you only want to have routine
and completion info of some libraries, it is sufficient to scan those
directories.  However, if you want IDLWAVE to detect possible name
conflicts with routines defined in other libraries, the whole pass
should be scanned. 

After selecting directories, click on the @w{@samp{[Scan & Save]}}
button in the widget to scan all files in the selected directories and
write the resulting routine information into the file
@code{idlwave-libinfo-file}.  In order to update the library information
from the same directories, call the command
@code{idlwave-update-routine-info} with a double prefix argument:
@w{@kbd{C-u C-u C-c C-i}}.  This will rescan files in the previously
selected directories, write an updated version of the libinfo file and
rebuild IDLWAVEs internal lists.

A note of caution:  Depending on your local installation, the IDL
library can be very large.  Parsing it for routine information will take
time and loading this information into Emacs can require a
significant amount of memory.  However, having this information
available will be a great help.

@cindex Application, testing for shadowing
@cindex Buffer, testing for shadowing

IDLWAVE can compile a list of routines which are defined in several
different files.  Since one definition will hide (shadow) the others
depending on which file is compiled first, such multiple definitions are
called "load-path shadows".  IDLWAVE has several routines to scan for
load path shadows.  The output is placed into the special buffer
@file{*Shadows*}.  The format of the output is identical to the source
section of the routine info buffer (@pxref{Routine Info}).  The
different definitions of a routine are listed in the sequence of
@emph{likelyhood of use}.  So the first entry will be most likely the
one you'll get if an unsuspecting command uses that routine.  Before
listing shadows, you should make sure that routine info is up-to-date by
pressing @kbd{C-c C-i}.  Here are the different routines:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x idlwave-list-buffer-load-path-shadows}
This commands checks the names of all routines defined in the current
buffer for shadowing conflicts with other routines accessible to
IDLWAVE.  The command also has a key binding: @kbd{C-c C-b}
@item @kbd{M-x idlwave-list-shell-load-path-shadows}.
Checks all routines compiled under the shell for shadowing.  This is
very useful when you have written a complete application.  Just compile
the application, use @code{RESOLVE_ALL} to compile any routines used by
your code, update the routine info inside IDLWAVE with @kbd{C-c C-i} and
then check for shadowing.
@item @kbd{M-x idlwave-list-all-load-path-shadows}
This command checks all routines accessible to IDLWAVE for conflicts.
@end table

For these commands to work properly you should have scanned the entire
load path, not just selected directories.  Also, IDLWAVE should be able to
distinguish between the system library files (normally installed in
@file{/usr/local/rsi/idl/lib}) and any site specific or user specific
files.  Therefore, such local files should not be installed
inside the @file{lib} directory of the IDL directory.  This is of course
also advisable for many other reasons.

@cindex Windows
@cindex MacOS
@cindex IDL variable @code{!DIR}
@cindex @code{!DIR}, IDL variable
Users of Windows and MacOS also must set the variable
@code{idlwave-system-directory} to the value of the @code{!DIR} system
variable in IDL.  IDLWAVE appends @file{lib} to the value of this
variable and assumes that all files found on that path are system
routines.

Another way to find out if a specific routine has multiple definitions
on the load path is routine info display (@pxref{Routine Info}).

IDLWAVE derives it knowledge about system routines from the IDL
manuals.  The file @file{idlw-rinfo.el} contains the routine information
for the IDL system routines.  The Online Help feature of IDLWAVE
requires ASCII versions of some IDL manuals to be available in a
specific format (@file{idlw-help.txt}), along with an Emacs-Lisp file
@file{idlw-help.el} with supporting code and pointers to the ASCII file.

All 3 files can be derived from the IDL documentation.  If you are
lucky, the maintainer of IDLWAVE will always have access to the newest
version of IDL and provide updates.  The IDLWAVE distribution also
contains the Perl program @file{get_rinfo} which constructs these files
by scanning selected files from the IDL documentation.  Instructions on
how to use @file{get_rinfo} are in the program itself.

@cindex Interview, with the maintainer

@noindent
@b{Question:} So now you have all these complicated configuration
options in your package, but which ones do @emph{you} as the maintainer
actually set in your own configuration?

@noindent
@b{Answer:} Hardly any.  As the maintainer, I set the default of most
options to what I think is best.  However, the default settings do not
turn on features which

@itemize @minus
@item
are not self-evident (i.e. too magic) when used by an unsuspecting user
@item
are too intrusive
@item
will not work properly on all Emacs installations out there
@item
break with widely used standards.
@end itemize

@noindent To see what I mean, here is the @emph{entire} configuration I
have in my @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(control shift)
      idlwave-store-inquired-class t
      idlwave-shell-automatic-start t
      idlwave-main-block-indent 2

@end lisp

However, if you are an Emacs power-user and want IDLWAVE to work
completely differently, the options allow you to change almost every
aspect of it.  Here is an example of a much more extensive configuration
of IDLWAVE.  To say it again - this is not what I recommend, but the
