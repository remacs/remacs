* Changes in MH-E 7.3

This release includes the new features of an index view of unseen
messages in all folders, spam software support, relative folder
specification @ support, marking messages, recipient handling by
mh-default-folder-list, Face and X-Image-URL header field support, and
Fcc completion. Function arguments have been unified. Bugs have been
fixed.

** New Features in MH-E 7.3

*** Unified Function Arguments

Any function with MSG-OR-SEQ in its docstring uses the displayed
message by default for this argument. However, if a prefix argument is
provided, then the user is prompted for a message sequence. If the
variable `transient-mark-mode' is non-nil and the mark is active, then
the function operates on the messages in the selected region. In a
program, MSG-OR-SEQ can be a message number, a list of message
numbers, a region in a cons cell, or a sequence.

*** MH-Index View of Unseen Messages

Use "F n (mh-index-new-messages)" or Folder -> View New Messages menu
item to display messages in the `mh-unseen-seq' sequence in folders
specified by `mh-index-new-messages-folders'. With a prefix argument,
enter a space-separated list of folders, or nothing to search all
folders.

Like other MH-Index folders, use "v (mh-index-visit-folder)" if you
wish to visit the original folder with the unseen message. This is
usually not necessary since the original message is annotated if you
reply, deleted if you delete the message, or refiled if you refile the
message (closes SF #701756).

*** Spam Software Support

MH-E now supports several spam filters including Bogofilter,
SpamProbe, and SpamAssassin. Spam that is mistakenly considered to be
good mail can be reclassified as spam with "J b (mh-junk-blacklist)".
Conversely, good mail that is accidently considered to be spam can be
reclassified with "J w (mh-junk-whitelist)" (closes SF #669518).

If a message is blacklisted, and `mh-junk-mail-folder' is a string,
then the message is refiled to that folder. If this variable is nil,
the message is deleted. If a message is whitelisted, then the message
is refiled to `mh-inbox'.

To change the spam program being used, customize `mh-junk-program'.
This should only be necessary if you have multiple filters on your
system and MH-E picked the wrong one. These customization variables
are found in the new customization group `mh-junk'.

The documentation for the following functions describes what setup is
needed for the different spam fighting programs:

  - `mh-bogofilter-blacklist'
  - `mh-spamprobe-blacklist'
  - `mh-spamassassin-blacklist'

*** Relative Folder Specification @ Supported

You can now use the relative folder marker @ in folder names (closes
SF #666774).

*** Marking Messages

Messages can now be highlighted with "' (mh-toggle-tick)", Sequence ->
Toggle Tick Mark menu item or the "Toggle tick mark" button. These
messages are added to the "tick" sequence, although this sequence can
be changed in `mh-tick-seq'. The highlighting effect can be modified
by customizing `mh-folder-tick-face' (closes SF #623367).

There is also a new keybinding "/ ' (mh-narrow-to-tick)" and menu item
Sequence -> Narrow to Tick Sequence to narrow the view to the
highlighted messages.

*** mh-default-folder-list Now Takes Recipients

If you wish to file a message based upon the recipient of a message
(such as a mailing list), you can now indicate that when filling out
the address in the `mh-default-folder-list' customization variable.

*** Face Header Field Supported

In addition to the X-Face header field, the Face header field, which
can display color images, is now supported. As a bonus, the external
xface-e21 library is no longer required.

*** X-Image-URL Support

Images specified in X-Image-URL header fields are now supported.
See the customization variable `mh-fetch-x-image-url' to enable this
support.

*** Fcc Completion

Folders in Fcc fields in message drafts can now be completed with
M-TAB.

** New Variables in MH-E 7.3

Variables that have been added to MH-E that have not been discussed
elsewhere are listed here.

*** mh-auto-fields-list

Alist of addresses for which header lines are automatically inserted.
When a regular expression matches in the To or cc fields of a message,
the corresponding header field is automatically inserted in the
message header. It also allows the automatic setting of an identity
(using `mh-insert-identity') to set an alternate identity when sending
messages to a certain person or mailing list.

Since this is a more general use of `mh-insert-mail-followup-to-flag'
and `mh-insert-mail-followup-to-list', these variables have been removed.

*** mh-show-xface-face

Face for displaying the X-Face image.

*** mh-xemacs-toolbar-position

This customization variable allows the user to place the toolbar on
the four edges of the frame.

*** mh-xemacs-use-toolbar-flag

This customization variable is used to enable or disable the toolbar
under XEmacs.

** Variables Deleted in MH-E 7.3

Variables that have been removed from MH-E that have not been
discussed elsewhere are listed here.

*** mh-decode-content-transfer-encoded-message-flag

No longer needed since the external program mimencode is no longer
used.

*** mh-index-show-hook

This hook was never used, so it was removed.

*** mh-tool-bar-reply-3-buttons-flag

Obsolete. This functionality is present `mh-tool-bar-folder-buttons'.

** Bug Fixes in MH-E 7.3

*** Can't Refile Message

Messages with invalid addresses were causing errors in ali which
prevented the refiling of messages. The ali error is now shown in the
"*MH-E Log*" buffer and refiling suggests the last folder used (closes
SF #680388).

*** Empty Body Triggers Duped Header

If the body was empty the header would be treated like the body and
was therefore displayed twice. This has been fixed (closes SF
#681162).

*** mml or mhl Directives Not Always Processed

The mml and mhl directives used to create body parts were not
processed if one re-edited a draft, or if they added the directives
manually. The directives are now always processed upon sending the
letter. You may still, of course, use "C-c C-m m (mh-mml-to-mime)" or
"C-c C-e (mh-edit-mhn)" to manually create the MIME body parts from
the directives and then send the draft.

*** mh-alias-grab-from-field Fails

MH-E was adding aliases with angle brackets around the address when
there wasn't a phrase (usually, the user's name), to go with it. This
caused ali to fail which caused problems in MH-E. This is probably a
bug in ali, but MH-E no longer inserts angle brackets around the
address unless there is a phrase, which avoids the problem (closes SF
#690216).

*** XEmacs Fixes

MH-E is now fully supported under XEmacs and compiles without any
warnings.

In particular, the following now work under XEmacs:

- X-Face, Face, and X-Image-URL header fields
- MH-E logo in mode line
- Emphasis (bold, italics, etc.)
- Smilies
- Toolbar

*** Indexed Folders Should Respect mh-show-threads-flag

Indexed folders are now threaded if `mh-show-threads-flag' is non-nil
(closes SF #709667).

*** Threading Index View Loses Folder Info

This has been fixed (closes SF #709672).

*** No Undo Information When Re-editing Drafts

Undo is turned on in the draft buffer when using "e (mh-edit-again)"
(closes SF #712777).

*** Forwarded base64-encoded Messages Are Incorrectly Displayed

This has been fixed (closes SF #681518).

*** Append to *MH-E Log* Buffer

The last 100 lines of log messages are kept in the *MH-E Log* buffer.
Previously, the buffer was erased every time it was written (closes SF
#685476). In addition, many of the MH-E commands now send their output
into this buffer instead of a plethora of other special-purpose
buffers.

*** mh-inc-folder Complains if No Mail and No Current Message

The function `mh-inc-folder' no longer calls `mh-show' if point is not
on a valid scan line. This keeps `mh-inc-folder' from complaining
(closes SF #678115).

*** Folder Normalization Strips Leading Slash

Leading "/" characters in folder names entered by the user were being
lost. This has been fixed (closes SF #676890).

*** Print Header Doesn't Show Message

When printing a sequence, the header simply indicated that a sequence,
but not which one, was being printed and did not show the message
number. This has been fixed. If more than one message is printed, a
page of the scan lines is printed and its header indicates the
sequence or message range. The pages with the actual messages all set
the header to the folder and message displayed on that page.

*** Aliases Constantly Reloaded

Empty lists are now handled properly (closes SF #693859).

*** Remove RCS Keywords

Removed RCS keywords per Emacs conventions (closes SF #680731).

*** Replace Mimencode

MH-E was enhanced to decode message based on charset and
Content-Transfer-Encoding. This eliminates the need for the external
program mimencode (closes SF #674857).



* Changes in MH-E 7.2

This release includes the new features of filing hints, hierarchical
file name completion, indexed search and pick integration, unification
between `mh-visit-folder' and the speedbar, a displayed message
indicator, buffer name organization, support for mairix indexed
search, and last but not least, the MH-E logo has been added to the
mode line. Code that handles sequences and message regions runs
faster. Bugs have been fixed.

** New Features in MH-E 7.2

*** Filing Hints

When you file a message, MH-E now looks for an alias corresponding to
the address of the sender and offers that as a default folder (closes
SF #657096). The new variable `mh-default-folder-prefix' can be used
to put these folders in a sub-folder. The new variable
`mh-default-folder-must-exist-flag' means to suppress the suggested
folder (thereby providing the previous folder used) if the folder
doesn't already exist. The new variable `mh-default-folder-list' can
be used to map additional addresses and folders.

*** Hierarchical File Name Completion

When you completed filenames in the past, you were presented with a
list of all your folders at all depths in the tree. Now you are
presented with only one level at a time (closes SF #664821).
As a result, the variables `mh-auto-folder-collect-flag' and
`mh-folder-list-change-hook' are obsolete.

*** Indexed Search and Pick Integration

The indexed and pick searches have been integrated (closes SF
#664816). Both "F s (mh-search-folder)" and "F i (mh-index-search)"
use the pick template for forming queries. To submit the query, use
"C-c C-c (mh-do-search)" which will use the query method you selected.
If you change your mind while forming the query, you can use "C-c C-i
(mh-index-do-search)" or "C-c C-p (mh-pick-do-search)" to submit the
query using the respective method.

Second, the results from a pick search are now saved in a sub-folder
of +mhe-index like an indexed search.

Third, `pick' is now a valid choice for `mh-index-program'.

*** mh-visit-folder Metamorphosis Continues

When visiting a folder from the speedbar, only the unseen messages are
shown if there are unseen messages. If there aren't any unseen
messages, all of the messages are shown if there are fewer than
`mh-large-folder' messages; otherwise, the user is prompted for the
range of messages to display. The "F v (mh-visit-folder)" command has
been modified to mimic this behavior. Use a prefix arg to force the
message range prompt.

*** Displayed Message Indicator

In graphical Emacs, the message that is shown is marked by a triangle
in the fringe. In textual Emacs, there is a ">" in the first column
(closes SF #664824).

*** Buffer Name Organization

All ephemeral buffer names start with " *mh" while all interesting
buffers start with "*MH-E ". The "*Folders*", "*Sequences*", and
"*Recipients*" buffers were therefore renamed to "*MH-E Folders*",
"*MH-E Sequences*" and "*MH-E Recipients*" respectively (programmers
should see mh-utils.el for the names of the new constants). Also, the
output of MH commands is saved in the "*MH-E Log*" buffer.

*** mh-index-program

Add choices for `mairix' and `pick'.

*** Logo Displayed on Mode Line

** New Variables in MH-E 7.2

The new variables have been discussed elsewhere.

** Bug Fixes in MH-E 7.2

*** mh-decode-content-transfer-encoded-message

Messages that had been encoded with base64 were not decoded. This has
been fixed with this new function (closes SF #674190). As a result,
the variable `mh-decode-quoted-printable-flag' has been renamed to
`mh-decode-content-transfer-encoded-message-flag'.

*** mh-kill-folder

Now restores previous window configuration (closes SF #664828).

*** mh-mime-display

MH-E was not using the charset defined in the content-type
header. This meant that mail in a different charset would not
be properly displayed. This has been fixed (closes SF #655123).

*** mh-read-address

In XEmacs and Emacs20, this function would always prompt using "To: "
instead of using the command argument. This has been fixed (closes SF
#670913).

*** mh-rmail

Unseen messages are now shown in addition to new ones (closes SF
#667542).

*** mh-scan-msg-overflow-regexp

Change the variable so that a space is always maintained in the
beginning of the scan line.

*** mh-swish-execute-search

The example configuration file in the docstring didn't show the
backslash in the FileRules filename. If the example had been used
literally by the user, no files would be indexed! This has been fixed
(closes SF #665888).

*** mh-thread-refile

The "T o (mh-thread-refile)" command did not provide refiling hints
like `mh-refile-msg'. This has been fixed (closes SF #664829).

*** mh-toggle-threads

If the threaded view was modified and then toggled, the standard view
may not have been accurate (as it contained a potentially old first
message to last message range). This has been fixed (closes SF
#626117).

*** mh-tool-bar-show-set, mh-tool-bar-letter-set, mh-tool-bar-folder-set

Clicking the customize and help buttons now deletes the other windows
in the frame.

*** mh-version

The "M-x mh-version" command displayed "Aliasfile: aliases". This has
been fixed (closes SF #664467). See Buffer Name Organization above.



* Changes in MH-E 7.1

This release includes the new features of multiple identities and
alias completion. In addition, indexed searching has been revamped.
Various other features have been added and a few bugs were fixed.

** New Features in MH-E 7.1

*** Multiple Identities

MH-E now supports multiple identities (closes SF #628782). That means
that you can have different From and Organization header fields (or
any other header field of your choice) as well as different signatures
depending on your context. Usually, the contexts are home and work.

Add your identities to the variable `mh-identity-list' and set the
default identity with the variable `mh-identity-default'. Your
identity can be switched on the fly by using the Identity menu or by
calling "M-x mh-insert-identity RET".

This functionality can be customized within the mh-identity group.

*** Alias Completion and Harvesting

The contributed file mh-alias.el has been rewritten and incorporated
into MH-E.

By default, aliases are culled from the system files
"/etc/nmh/MailAliases," "/usr/lib/mh/MailAliases," and "/etc/passwd"
(see `mh-alias-system-aliases') and from your "AliasFile" MH profile
component. These aliases are then used for completion in the
minibuffer when entering addresses. Within the header of the message
draft, "M-TAB (mh-letter-complete)" is used to do alias completion.

The package also provides for alias creation based upon the From
header field of the current message. Use the lasso button
(mh-alias-grab-from-field).

This functionality can be customized within the mh-alias group.

*** Index Folder Updates

The results of an index search "F i (mh-index-search)" are now stored
in a bona fide folder so that you can refile messages and reply to
messages directly from the result folder. This folder is a sub-folder
of +mhe-index and the name is based upon the search string (closes SF
#623321).

If a prefix argument is given then the search in the current index
buffer is redone.

The index folder lists the names of the source folders as before.
However, instead of using RET on the name of the folder to visit the
folder, use "v (mh-show-index-visit-folder)" anywhere within the
results to visit that folder narrowed to the results of the search.
Additional functions have been added to navigate including "TAB
(mh-index-next-folder)", and "SHIFT-TAB (mh-index-previous-folder)."

*** mh-visit-folder Interface Updated

A change was made to the prompting of the message range. In general,
you can use the same format for messages and sequences as you can in
MH with a single exception: a single number means to scan that many
messages, rather than scan that message number. This turns out to be
much more useful than visiting a single message and is consistent with
Gnus and the MH-E speedbar (closes SF #655891).

If mh-visit-folder is called non-interactively and RANGE is nil then
all messages are displayed. This behavior is now documented and
provides backwards compatibility.

*** Threading Improvements

After incorporating new mail into a threaded folder, unseen messages
can be spread about. Two new functions have been added to make it
easier to find them: these are "M-n (mh-next-unread-msg)" and "M-p
(mh-previous-unread-msg)" (closes SF #630328)

Two new functions were added to delete and refile threads. They are "T
d (mh-thread-delete)" and "T o (mh-thread-refile)" respectively
(closes SF #630493).

In addition, the key "k" used to be bound to the function
`mh-delete-subject': it is now bound to
`mh-show-delete-subject-or-thread'.

New functions to navigate threads include "T u (mh-thread-ancestor)",
which can jump to the root message of the current thread given an
optional argument, "T n (mh-thread-next-sibling)", and "T p
(mh-thread-previous-sibling)"

*** Refiling of Messages in Region

If mark is active and `transient-mark-mode' is enabled then all the
messages in the region are refiled.

*** vCard Handling

If a signature cannot be identified, but there is a vCard attachment,
then that vCard will be presented as a signature (closes SF #649216).

*** New Info Added to mh-version

Information about Gnus versions available at both compile time and run
time has been added.

** New Variables in MH-E 7.1

The defcustom groups were reorganized. Rather than iterate the
specific changes here, you are invited to browse the groups with "M-x
mh-customize RET".

*** mh-alias-completion-ignore-case-flag

Non-nil means don't consider case significant in MH alias completion.
This is the default in plain MH, so it is the default here as well. It
can be useful to set this to t if, for example, you use lowercase
aliases for people and uppercase for mailing lists.

*** mh-alias-expand-aliases-flag

Non-nil means to expand aliases entered in the minibuffer. In other
words, aliases entered in the minibuffer will be expanded to the full
address in the message draft. By default, this expansion is not
performed.

*** mh-alias-flash-on-comma

Specify whether to flash the translation of the alias or warn if there
isn't a translation of the alias.

*** mh-alias-insert-file

Filename to use to store new MH-E aliases. This variable can also be a
list of filenames, in which case MH-E will prompt for one of them. If
nil, the default, then MH-E will use the first file found in the
"AliasFile" component of the MH profile.

*** mh-alias-insertion-location

Specifies where new aliases are entered in alias files. Options are
sorted alphabetically (the default), at the top of the file or at the
bottom.

*** mh-alias-local-users

If t, local users are completed in MH-E To: and Cc: prompts.

If you set this variable to a string, it will be executed to generate
a password file. A value of "ypcat passwd" is helpful if NIS is in
use.

*** mh-alias-system-aliases

A list of system files from which to cull aliases. If these files are
modified, they are automatically reread. This list need include only
system aliases and the passwd file, since personal alias files listed
in your "AliasFile" MH profile component are automatically included.

*** mh-identity-default

Default identity to use when `mh-letter-mode' is called.

*** mh-identity-list

List holding MH-E identity.

*** mh-invisible-header-fields

Simple user interface to change `mh-invisible-headers'.

*** mh-letter-complete-function

Function to call when completing outside of fields specific to
aliases. By default, it is bound to 'ispell-complete-word.

*** mh-show-threads-flag

Non-nil means new folders start in threaded mode. Threading large
number of messages can be time consuming. So if the flag is non-nil
then threading will be done only if the number of messages being
threaded is less than `mh-large-folder' (closes SF #646794).

*** mh-tool-bar-folder-buttons

Buttons to include in MH-E folder/show toolbar.

*** mh-tool-bar-letter-buttons

Buttons to include in MH-E letter toolbar.

** Bug Fixes in MH-E 7.1

*** mh-get-new-mail

Call new function `mh-add-cur-notation' to undo the work of
`mh-remove-cur-notation' if there was no new mail (closes SF #647681).

*** mh-set-cmd-note

No longer updates the default `mh-cmd-note' value. This resulted in
the misplacement of the current mark when the message number width
changed (closes SF #643701).



* Changes in MH-E 7.0

This is a major release which includes a lot of new features including
improved MIME handling, speedbar folder browsing, and indexed
searching. In this version, MH-E runs under XEmacs, passes checkdoc,
and compiles clean under all supported platforms.

The "passes checkdoc" feature above required changing the name of
several user-visible variables. It is likely that this affects you.
Please be sure to see the table at the end of these notes and rename
your variables accordingly.

MH-E has been written mh-e, Mh-e, MH-e and MH-E. We have decided that
the proper term should be MH-E. Please try to use MH-E in your
writing.

** New Features in MH-E 7.0

*** Speedbar

There is now support for the speedbar. Try "M-x speedbar" (closes SF
#503727).

Press the middle mouse button on the `+' icons to open a folder,
middle mouse button on a folder name to open the folder. Folders with
unseen messages are shown in bold, so this is a handy way to browse
new messages that you have filed with procmail or slocal.

See the new customization variable `mh-large-folder,' which controls
when the speedbar asks for how many messages to scan when opening a
large folder and `mh-speed-run-flists-flag' whose default value of t
means to use the flists command to populate the count of unseen and
total messages in each folder.

*** Indexed Search

Interoperability with swish++, swish, glimpse, and namazu has been
added to enable lightening-fast searches of your mail. If none of
these are present, grep is used. Try "F i (mh-index-search)".

For more information, read the documentation for the functions
`mh-swish++-execute-search,' `mh-swish-execute-search,'
`mh-namazu-execute-search,' or `mh-glimpse-execute-search' depending
on your preferred indexing program to see what kind of setup is needed
to generate the index.

*** Threading

Use "T t (mh-toggle-threads)" to view the threads in the folder. Use
it again to return to a non-threaded view.

*** Brief Help

Use "? (mh-help)" and "X ? (mh-prefix-help)," where X is a prefix
character, for a brief synopsis in the minibuffer of frequently used
commands. In the MH-Letter or MH-Pick buffers, use "C-c ? (mh-help)"
(closes SF #493740).

*** Folder Keymap Shared by Show Buffer

You can now use the MH-Folder mode commands from the MH-Show buffer.
Because of this, the MH-Show buffer is now read-only (closes SF
#493749 and SF #527946) and you now have to use "M (mh-modify)" to
edit a message.

*** Better Scanning

You no longer have to modify your scan format if your folders have
more than 9999 messages in them. If you've only modified your scan
format file to allow for the wider message numbers, consider using the
default behavior of MH-E and simplify your MH-E configuration
considerably (closes SF #635791).

To do this, you may have to remove your modifications of
`mh-scan.*-regexp' and `mh-cmd-note' and your customization of
`mh-scan-format-file'.

You may still want the updated format files for running MH commands
outside of MH-E; the default of `mh-scan-format-file' will cause them
to be ignored.

If you prefer fixed-width message numbers, set the new customization
variable to nil , set this variable to
nil and call `mh-set-cmd-note' with the width specified by the scan format in
`mh-scan-format-file'. For example, the default width is 4, so you would use
"(mh-set-cmd-note 4)" if `mh-scan-format-file' were nil.

*** X-Face

MH-E now displays the content of the X-Face header field in the From
field. When sending a message, an X-Face field is appended to the
header if it doesn't already exist and "~/.face" is present. See the
new customization variables `mh-show-use-xface-flag' and `mh-x-face-file'
(closes SF #480770).

MH-E depends on the external x-face package found in
ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/ to do this. The `uncompface' binary is
also required to be in the execute PATH. It can be obtained from:
http://freshmeat.net/redir/compface/1439/url_tgz/compface-1.4.tar.gz.

It has also been observed that if you don't see the faces, you might
have to do this (for unknown reasons):

    mv /usr/local/include/compface.h /usr/include/

*** Graphical Smileys

Smiley's are now converted to cute little images. See the new
customization variable `mh-graphical-smileys-flag.'

*** Text Emphasis

ASCII formatting is now converted to the appropriate font. For
example, _underline_ is underlined, *bold* appears in bold, /italic/
appears in italic, etc. See `gnus-emphasis-alist' for the whole list.
See the new customization variables `mh-decode-mime' and
`mh-graphical-emphasis-flag.'

*** Attachment Handling

Inline attachments are now displayed. Regular attachments appear as
buttons in show buffer. Use "K TAB (mh-next-button)" or "K SHIFT-TAB
(mh-prev-button)" to cycle through these buttons. Use "K v
(mh-folder-toggle-mime-part)" to view, "K o
(mh-folder-save-mime-part)" to save one part or "K-a
(mh-save-mime-parts)" to save all parts, or "K i
(mh-folder-inline-mime-part)" to view the attachment inline.

See the new customization variable `mh-decode-mime' for additional
information. Other customization variables that affect this new feature
include `mh-store-mime-parts-default-directory' and
`mh-display-buttons-for-inline-parts-flag'.

HTML documents can be viewed inline if Gnus v5.10 and w3 or w3m lisp
packages are present. Set the customization variable
`mm-text-html-renderer' accordingly (closes SF #453352).

*** Quoted-printable Handling

Quoted-printable body parts are now decoded.

*** More Choices for `mh-yank-from-start-of-msg'

Historically, if this variable was t, the entire message, with full
headers would be included and every line would begin with
`mh-ins-buf-prefix.' This usage is deprecated in favor of the setting
`supercite' below. The default has been changed to `attribution.' The
following symbols are now understood:

`body': yank the message minus the header.

`supercite': include the entire message, with full headers. This also
causes the invocation of `sc-cite-original' without the setting of
`mail-citation-hook', now deprecated practice.

`autosupercite': do as for `supercite' automatically when show buffer
matches the message being replied-to.

`attribution': yank the message minus the header and add a simple
attribution line at the top.

`autoattrib': do as for `attribution' automatically when show buffer
matches the message being replied-to.

There is a new customization variable called
`mh-extract-from-attribution-verb' which is used for attribution which
provides a method for setting a different language.

*** Use Gnus mml Instead of mhn

When inserting attachments into a message draft, Gnus mml directives
are now used instead of mhn directives. One beneficial side-effect of
this is that attachments can now appear inline as well as separate.

The new customization variable `mh-compose-insertion' controls whether
Gnus or mhn is used to insert MIME message directives in messages
(default: 'gnus, if the mml library exists).

*** Content-Type Now Obtained Automatically

The value of the Content-Type no longer needs to be entered by the
user.

*** Attachments Automatically Included Upon Send

You no longer have to run "C-c C-e (mh-edit-mhn)" before sending a
message with attachments--this is done automatically when you send the
message with "C-c C-c (mh-send-letter)". There is, however, a new key
binding "C-c C-m m (mh-mml-to-mime)" which is analogous to "C-c C-e
(mh-edit-mhn)".

*** GPG Handling

Messages that have been signed or encrypted with GPG are verified and
decrypted automatically. To sign or encrypt a message, use "C-c RET
C-s (mh-mml-secure-message-sign-pgpmime)" and "C-c C-m C-e
(mh-mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime)." You need Gnus version 5.10
for this feature. These functions are provided by the pgg.el package.

Users report "flashing" with the pgg.el package and prefer the gpg.el
package instead. To use gpg.el instead of the pgg.el package you need:

  (setq mml2015-use 'gpg)

To mimic automatic encryption in gpg.el, use:

  (setq mm-verify-option 'always)
  (setq mm-decrypt-option 'always)

The venerable mailcrypt package is also an option. However, now that
show buffers are read-only, mailcrypt version 3.5.6 and older fail
when they attempt to decrypt the contents.

*** Mail-Followup-To Header Field

Support for this controversial field has been added because nmh
supports it (closes SF #627035). If you want to add it to outgoing
mail for selected mailing lists, add those mailing lists to the new
customization variable `mh-insert-mail-followup-to-list.' If you think
this field is evil, set the new customization variable
`mh-insert-mail-followup-to-flag' to nil.

*** Gnus Issues

If you update Gnus, you must recompile MH-E. Note that if you are
running the stock version of MH-E that comes with Emacs or the MH-E
package on a Debian GNU/Linux, this is done for you.

** New Variables in MH-E 7.0

New customization variables not mentioned earlier include:

*** mh-letter-insert-signature-hook

Invoked at the beginning of the "C-c C-s (mh-insert-signature)"
command. Can be used to determine which signature file to use based on
message content. On return, if `mh-signature-file-name' is non-nil
that file will be inserted at the current point in the buffer.

*** mh-show-maximum-size

Maximum size of message (in bytes) to display automatically. Provides
an opportunity to skip over large messages which may be slow to load.
Use a value of 0 to display all messages automatically regardless of
size (closes SF #488696).

*** mh-tool-bar-reply-3-buttons-flag

Non-nil means use three buttons for reply commands in tool-bar. If you
have room on your tool-bar because you are using a large font, you may
set this variable to expand the single reply button into three buttons
that won't lead to minibuffer prompt about who to reply to.

** Bug Fixes in MH-E 7.0

*** mh-delete-msg, mh-refile-msg, mh-undo

Mandrake Linux includes XEmacs initialization code that binds
`transient-mark-mode' which causes problems in MH-E. These problems
have been fixed (closes SF #541915).

*** mh-edit-again

This would sometimes yield a read-only buffer. This has been fixed
(closes SF #624283 and SF #625538).

*** mh-forward

When using nmh, always specify -mime so as to preserve the original
message(s).

*** mh-inc-folder

If you had narrowed to a sequence and then incorporated new mail,
those new messages would not be present in your +inbox when you
widened. This has been fixed (closes SF #489430, SF #489437, SF
#629233).

*** mh-insert-letter

No longer uses mhl to include a message as this mangled the header and
gave supercite fits (closes SF #629153).

*** mh-letter-mode

"M-q (fill-paragraph)" now fills quoted paragraphs (for example,
starting with "> ") correctly (closes SF #489927).

*** mh-next-undeleted-msg, mh-previous-undeleted-msg

If there are no more undeleted messages the point remains at its
original position and a message is produced (closes SF #494304).

*** mh-pick-mode

Now calls `mh-pick-mode-hook' as documented.

*** mh-put-msg-in-seq

Now puts all messages in region in sequence (closes SF #630324).

*** mh-refile-msg, mh-write-msg-to-file

These functions stomped on the variables that held the name of the
last file and folder respectively for the other function. This has
been fixed so that the last folder or file name is preserved (closes
SF #580772).

*** mh-region-to-sequence

If the region in MH-Folder was set with "C-x h (mark-whole-buffer)",
you couldn't perform operations on all of the messages as you would
expect. This has been fixed (closes SF #621632).

*** mh-reply

Performing an undo the first thing after replying would blank out the
entire draft. Now just the insertion of the yanked message is undone
leaving the header and signature intact for additional editing (closes
SF #623693).

*** mh-show-mode

Now calls `mh-show-mode-hook' as documented (closes SF #627222).

*** mh-subject-thread-to-sequence

Make 'subject sequence a real one, exported to MH. This means you can,
for example, mh-forward it. But it also shows up with a mark in the
scan output (closes SF #489445).

*** Other Bug Fixes

The following bugs have also been closed:

SF #495450: Folder buffer read-only after inc
SF #489706: mh-page-msg bombs out
SF #580772: mh-last-destination is overloaded

*** Variables renamed to conform with Emacs coding conventions

The coding conventions require that boolean variables end in -flag.
The following two tables show which variables were affected (closes SF
#627015).

* Changes in mh-e 6.1

This is a minor release which includes a few bug fixes. The
distribution now includes the ChangeLog.

** New Features in mh-e 6.1

*** Fontification

Unseen messages now displayed in bold.

*** Viewing folders and sequences

The folder and sequence listings that "F l (mh-list-folders)" and "S l
(mh-list-sequences)" create are now displayed in view mode.

** Bug Fixes in mh-e 6.1

*** mh-folder-unseen-seq-name

Byte compilation failed when initializing this variable when the
user's MH environment was not set up. This has been fixed (closes
Debian #140232 and Debian #140817).

*** mh-forward

When forwarding a sequence, the mode of the draft would not be set to
MH-Letter correctly. This has been fixed (closes SF #489448).

*** mh-insert-prefix-string

Fixed to work under XEmacs. Thanks to Will Partain
<partain at dcs.gla.ac.uk>.

*** mh-quit

mh-quit now cleans up the buffers named `mh-temp-buffer,'
'mh-temp-folders-buffer' and 'mh-temp-sequences-buffer.'


* Changes in mh-e 6.0

mh-e is now maintained at SourceForge (see
http://mh-e.sourceforge.net/). This is where you need to go to obtain
new versions of mh-e, report bugs and receive support.

The maintainers have moved much of their personal configurations into
the codebase, so you may find that you may be able to reduce your mh-e
customizations as well.

There are several incompatibilities in this version from older
versions. Please read the following notes carefully for details. Pay
particular attention to the key binding changes in the MH-Folder
section. If you have customized your scan format, you will want to
read about the new variable `mh-scan-format-file'.

The manual could not be updated in time for this release. It will be
updated in the near future. If the Preface in your manual indicates
the older version (version 1.3, for mh-e version 5.0.2), please check
the following page occasionally for an update:

  https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13357


** New Features in mh-e 6.0

*** Customization

mh-e now uses the customize feature of Emacs. Use "M-x customize-group
mh RET" to customize mh-e.

*** Menus

All mh-e modes now provide menus that contain most mh-e functions.

*** Toolbars

All mh-e modes now have toolbar buttons for oft-used functions (Emacs 21).

*** Fontification

All mh-e buffers now have font-lock keywords. To use, either call
(turn-on-font-lock) from the appropriate hook, or set
`global-font-lock-mode' to t. To customize, use "M-x
customize-apropos-faces ^mh RET".

If you have customized your scan lines, you will have to update your
scan regexps. The existing regexps were changed to extract a match so
you will have to add appropriate grouping constructs to take advantage
of the fontification. Your old settings will continue to work, but the
folder will not be fontified. For example:

  (setq mh-good-msg-regexp  "^\\(.....\\)[^D^]")

You will most likely have to update the new variable
`mh-scan-subject-regexp' as well. There is another new variable
`mh-scan-date-regexp' which you may also find useful. Run "M-x apropos
mh.*regexp" for a complete list.

*** mail-user-agent support

You can now set `mail-user-agent' to `mh-e-user-agent' so that packages
that need to send mail will use mh-e (closes SF #406883, SF #470024).

*** replgroupcomps support

If you reply to `cc' or `all' and you use nmh, the nmh repl option
-group will be used. This means that the file `replgroupcomps' will be
used. If you have customized `replcomps', you will definitely want to
either copy `$NMH_LIB/replgroupcomps' to your mail directory and modify
it the same way that you modified your `replcomps' file, or simply
copy your `replcomps' file to `replgroupcomps'.

*** MH-Folder mode

The variable `mh-summary-height' used to have a default of 4. It now
varies from 4 to 10 depending on the height of the frame.

Clicking the mouse on a message shows that message.

Delete, refile and undo now operate on a region (but only if
`transient-mark-mode' is non-nil).

SPC (mh-page-msg) now displays the message if it is not already
visible. If the bottom of a message is showing, SPC (mh-page-msg)
moves to the next message (respecting the direction you are moving
through the folder).

The threading commands "T u (mh-next-unseen-subject-thread)",
"T t (mh-toggle-subject-thread)", "T s (mh-narrow-to-subject-thread)",
and "T k (mh-delete-subject-thread)" have been added. These functions
do not offer threading in the true sense of the word, but do allow
some manipulation by subject.

Major, major keymap changes. This was done to free up movement
commands in the buffer, and to provide for additional features, such
as the threading commands. At the same time, better and more
consistent mnemonics were realized that should make it easier to
remember key bindings.

Added new sub-keymaps for folder commands, sequence commands,
extraction commands, and digest commands which begin with with F, S,
X, and D, respectively. These sub-keymaps allowed some consistency
(e.g., especially with l(ist) and k(ill)).

Here are the actual changes and rationale:

Old	New	Rationale

e	-	Deleted. Already have x. Now used by mh-edit-again.
j	-	Deleted. Already have g.

M-a	e	Better mnemonic. Matches rmail. Frees movement command.
M-e	E	Better mnemonic. Consistent with e.
-	S	Why not? mh-sort-folder.

M-f	Fv	Frees movement command
M-f	Ff	Alias (keep?)
M-f	Fo	Alias (keep?)
M-k	Fk	No reason but to keep with folder commands
M-l	Fl	No reason but to keep with folder commands
M-p	Fp	No reason but to keep with folder commands
M-r	Fr	Frees movement command
M-s	Fs	No reason but to keep with folder commands
M-u	Fu	No reason but to keep with folder commands

M-%	Sd	Better mnemonic
M-#	Sk	Better mnemonic
M-q	Sl	Better mnemonic
C-xn	Sn	Frees up standard key binding
%	Sp	Better mnemonic for putting a message in a sequence
?	Ss	Shows sequences that message is in
C-xw	Sw	Frees up standard key binding

M-n	Xs	Better mnemonic (extract shar)
M-n	Xu	Better mnemonic (extract uuencode)

M-SPC	D SPC	Frees mark command
M-\177	D \177	No reason but to keep with digest commands
M-b	Db	Frees movement command

As the number of variables increases, it is becoming important to
organize the mh-e namespace. Several variables having to do with the
format of scan lines were renamed, as follows:

Old				New

mh-good-msg-regexp		mh-scan-good-msg-regexp
mh-deleted-msg-regexp		mh-scan-deleted-msg-regexp
mh-refiled-msg-regexp		mh-scan-refiled-msg-regexp
mh-valid-scan-line		mh-scan-valid-regexp
mh-cur-scan-msg-regexp		mh-scan-cur-msg-number-regexp
-				mh-scan-cur-msg-regexp
-				mh-scan-rcpt-regexp
-				mh-scan-format-regexp
mh-msg-number-regexp		mh-scan-msg-number-regexp
mh-msg-search-regexp		mh-scan-msg-search-regexp

*** MH-Show mode

While the MIME support is not complete, quoted-printable body parts
are now decoded.

Some MTAs quote From at the beginning of the line with a ">". The ">"
is now removed in the display, but not on disk.

*** MH-Letter mode

New function "C-c C-o (mh-split-line)" splits lines in a draft
preserving the fill prefix and indentation. This is useful when
responding to several sentences in a single paragraph separately.

"M-q (fill-paragraph)" can now be used on the message that is being
replied to. The fill prefix such as "> " is preserved.

You no longer have to run "C-c C-e (mh-edit-mhn)" manually as this is
now done automatically when the message is sent.

The X-Mailer header field is now added to messages as they are sent.

"C-c C-m C-i (mh-mhn-compose-insertion)" now makes a pretty good guess
at the type of file using the `file' command and no longer asks the
user for the media type. If the necessary version of `file' is not
available, the user is asked for the media type as before; however,
the list of media types is now taken from the system mailcap if
available. Failing that, the built-in list of types has been
supplemented so in most cases the type you need should be present
(closes SF #406883, #441179).

** New Variables in mh-e 6.0

New variables not mentioned earlier include:

*** mh-insert-x-mailer-p

Default value of t means that an X-Mailer header field should be
added.

*** mh-reply-show-message-p

The setting of this variable determines whether the MH show-buffer is
displayed with the current message when using mh-reply without a prefix
argument. Set it to nil if you already include the message
automatically in your draft using "repl: -filter repl.filter" in
"~/.mh_profile."

*** mh-scan-format-file

Specifies the format file to pass to the scan program. If t, the
format string will be taken from the either `mh-scan-format-mh' or
`mh-scan-format-nmh' depending on whether MH or nmh is in use. If nil,
the default scan output will be used.

If you customize the scan format, you may need to modify a few
variables containing regexps that mh-e uses to identify specific
portions of the output. Use `M-x apropos RET mh-scan.*regexp' to
obtain a list of these variables.

*** mh-scan-format-mh

Scan format string for MH, provided to the scan program via the
-format arg. This format is identical to the default except that
additional hints for fontification have been added to the sixth
column.

*** mh-scan-format-nmh

Scan format string for nmh, provided to the scan program via the
-format arg. This format is identical to the default except that
additional hints for fontification have been added to the sixth
column.

*** mh-show-use-goto-addr

Non-nil means URLs and e-mail addresses are highlighted using
goto-addr in MH-Show buffer.

*** mh-letter-fill-column

Fill column to use in `mh-letter-mode'. This is useful to make the
lines a bit shorter to allow for quoting in replies.

*** mh-folder-updated-hook

Invoked when the actions in a folder (such as moves and deletes) are
performed. Variables that are useful in this hook include
`mh-delete-list' and `mh-refile-list' which can be used to see which
changes are being made to current folder, `mh-current-folder'.

*** mh-unseen-updated-hook

Invoked after the unseen sequence has been updated. The variable
`mh-seen-list' can be used to obtain the list of messages which will
be removed from the unseen sequence

** Bug Fixes in mh-e 6.0

*** mh-edit-again and mh-extract-rejected-mail

Now insert a header separator (--------) which packages such as
mailcrypt expect.

*** mh-find-progs

Now uses `mhparam' to set `mh-lib-progs' and `mh-lib'. Added more
directories to `mh-progs' so that mh-e can autoconfigure in more
environments. Chances are that you no longer have to set these
variables, and if you do, you will only have to set `mh-progs'.
Unless, of course, you are using an ancient version of MH that doesn't
have `mhparam'.

*** mh-folder-mode-map

The DEL/<delete>/<backspace> change in Emacs 21 broke
`mh-previous-page'. This has been fixed (closes SF #228907).

*** mh-forward

If you had "forw: -mime" to your .mh_profile, forwarding a message
resulted in:

  Search failed: "^------- Forwarded Message"

In addition, the Subject field was not filled in. This has been fixed
(closes SF #223603).

*** mh-kill-folder

The user is now always prompted before this action; the variable
`mh-do-not-confirm' is no longer consulted here. Therefore users who
wanted to set `mh-do-not-confirm' but didn't because of the
`mh-kill-folder' dependency may now do so.

*** mh-make-folder-mode-line

Properly deals with folders that do not have any lines in them. Prints
"no msgs" instead of "0 msgs". Does not try to print a range when
there are no messages.

*** mh-mhn-compose-insertion

Now gets the MIME type automatically (assuming the local file command
supports the -i and -b options). If this use of the file command is
not supported, the list of MIME types has been expanded to use the
system's mailcap file.

*** mh-nmh-p

This variable (t when nmh is in use rather than MH) assumed that the
string "nmh" is in `mh-lib-progs' or `mh-lib'. This has been fixed
(closes SF #441776).

*** mh-refile-msg

No longer lets you specify an empty folder (closes SF #476824).

*** mh-regenerate-headers

Now suppresses "scan: bad message list" messages.

*** mh-print-msg

This function was looking for `mhl' in the wrong place on nmh on
Redhat LINUX 7.0. This has been fixed (closes SF #481128).

*** mh-show

Now updates `cur' sequence after a message is shown (closes SF #481772).

*** mh-showing

Renamed variable and function to `mh-showing-mode' to conform with
minor mode conventions. Added optional arg to function so it would
behave like a normal minor mode: no or nil arg toggles mode, 0 arg
turns off, non-nil turns on. This fixed the error that occurred when
`desktop-create-buffer' recreated mh-e buffers because it was calling
`mh-showing' with an arg.

*** mh-version

Fixed for nmh. Now displays mh-e version correctly. Cleaned up output
and display `mh-progs', etc.

*** mh-widen

Now attempts to stay on the same message number (closes SF #480922).

No longer wipes out pending deletes and refiles without warning
(closes SF #481036).


* Changes in mh-e 5.0.2

This version contains additional minor changes to integrate it with
reporter.el (requires reporter.el version 3.1c or later) and Emacs
19.30.  The mh-goto-msg function is much faster, which also speeds up
several other operations.


* Changes in mh-e 5.0.1

This version contains minor changes from mh-e 5.0 to integrate it with
Emacs 19.29.


* User-visible changes to mh-e 5.0

Note: This being a major release, there are many internal changes.
This document lists only changes to the external interfaces of mh-e.

When upgrading, you must either explicitly reload the new versions of
all mh-e files that are already loaded or restart your Emacs.


** Major Changes and New Features in mh-e 5.0

The emphasis for this release has been on consistency and
documentation. Many documentation strings were enhanced. Documentation
strings were changed to comments for internal functions and variables.

*** There is now proper documentation in the form of a 75-page users
manual. The Texinfo source is mh-e.texi; the formatted Info document
is mh-e.info.

*** There is a new command `mh-update-sequences', which updates MH's
idea of what messages are in the Unseen sequence and what is the
current folder and message. `mh-quit' calls it. While
`mh-execute-commands' has always done this updating as a side effect,
the new function is faster.

*** The MH profile entry "Inbox:" is supported.

*** If the show-buffer is modified, the user is queried before mh-e
reuses the buffer to show a different message. This buffer is also
auto-saved and backed up correctly.

*** `mh-store-buffer' is significantly more robust. It now handles
messages created by a wide variety of packaging software. The status
message for `uudecode' includes the name of the file created. An error
is signaled if the subprocess exits with a non-zero status.

*** `mh-search-folder' behaves predictably, adding messages found to
the `search' sequence. It correctly handles the case of no messages
found.

*** `mh-burst-digest' (`M-b') now only rescans the part of the folder
affected by the burst. It is now much faster in a large folder.


** New Hooks and Customization Variables in mh-e 5.0

*** `mh-default-folder-for-message-function': new name for the old
`mh-msg-folder-hook', which wasn't a hook. The old name was confusing,
leading people to think they could use `add-hook' with it, when
actually `setq' is the correct way.

*** `mh-sortm-args': When this variable is used has changed. Now
`mh-sortm-args' is passed if there IS a prefix argument to
`mh-sort-folder'. The assumption is that for arguments you normally
want, you would specify them in an MH profile entry.

*** `mh-mhn-args': new hook, a list of additional arguments to pass to
the `mhn' program if `mh-edit-mhn' is given a prefix argument.

*** `mh-edit-mhn-hook': new hook called by `mh-edit-mhn', the function
that formats MIME messages.

*** `mh-folder-list-change-hook': new hook, called whenever the cached
list of folders, `mh-folder-list', is changed.

*** `mh-find-path-hook': new hook, called when entering mh-e.

*** `mh-repl-formfile': new variable, used to change the format file
used by `mh-reply' from the default of "replcomps".

*** New variables to customize the scan format and notating:
`mh-note-deleted', `mh-note-refiled', `mh-note-seq', `mh-note-cur',
`mh-note-copied', `mh-note-printed'.


** Key Binding Changes in mh-e 5.0

*** `RET' runs `mh-show' for consistency with the Finder and Info. The
old binding `.' still works, but `RET' is now the standard binding.

*** `M-<' now runs `mh-first-msg' for consistency with `M->', which
runs `mh-last-msg'.

*** `C-c C-f C-d' in MH-Letter mode moves to a Dcc: header field.

*** `C-c C-f C-r' in MH-Letter mode moves to a From: header field.

*** `g' is now the standard binding for `mh-goto-msg'. The old binding
`j' still works.


** Other Improvements and Changes to mh-e 5.0

*** `mh-lpr-command-format' no longer passes the "-p" argument to
`lpr' by default. The mail header typically has the date anyway.

*** When prompting for a sequence name, if no sequences have been used
yet, mh-e will offer the first sequence the current message is in.

*** The patterns of more mailers are recognized by
`mh-extract-rejected-mail'.

*** `mh-insert-prefix-string' no longer wraps the call to the
`mail-citation-hook' function in a `save-excursion' so the hook writer
can choose whether to leave point at the beginning or the end of the
yanked text.

*** `mh-write-msg-to-file': The prompt now refers to "message" or
"message body" depending on which will be written. (This is controlled
by a prefix argument.) The file defaults to the last-used file instead
of supplying only the directory name.

*** mh-e uses message ranges when running MH commands. Thus "rmm 1 2 3
4 6" is now "rmm 1-4 6". This change makes it less likely to overflow
system argument list limits, and it might be faster, too.


** Bug Fixes to mh-e 5.0

*** mh-e's idea of the unseen sequence now stays in sync with MH's
better.

*** Functions that are supposed to find fields in the message header
no longer look in the message body.

*** mh-e would sometimes fail to remove the "%" from a scan line when
the message was removed from a sequence if the message was also in the
Previous sequence.

*** The variable `mh-inc-prog' is now correctly used in all places.

*** `mh-pipe-msg' runs the process in the correct directory.

*** A partially scanned folder will no longer lose the "/select"
annotation when you execute marked deletes and refiles with `x'.


* Changes to mh-e 4.0

This file is automatically generated from news-mh-e.txinfo.  Do not edit.

[MH-E-ONEWS has been incorporated here and removed. news-mh-e.txinfo
is no longer available.]

Note: there are many internal changes to mh-e in this release.  If you
have the previous version loaded into your Emacs, you will probably not
be able to load this version on top of it.

** New Features in mh-e 4.0

*** Background folder collection. The first time you are prompted for
a folder, you must wait while mh-e collects the names of all existing
folders. Now however, if you abort, collecting will continue in the
background, and you can do something else in Emacs until the
collection completes. Normally, mh-e will begin collecting folders
names in the background when you first load it; you can disable this
feature by setting `mh-auto-folder-collect' to nil.

*** There is support for composing MIME messages using the `mhn'
program from MH 6.8. See the documentation string for mh-edit-mhn.
(While composing a letter, type `C-h k C-c C-e'.) See also mhn(1).
There is as yet no support for reading MIME messages.

*** `mh-show', typically on `.', repositions to the start of the
message if the message is already visible. It used to do nothing in
this case.

*** The function `mh-unshar-msg' is renamed `mh-store-msg'. It now
does uudecoding, too. Someday it should do MIME. It remembers the last
directory you used and offers it as the default for next time.

*** New function `mh-header-display', on `,', displays the message
with all headers, including those normally not displayed. Type `.' to
display the message normally again.

*** New function `mh-list-sequences' lists the sequences in use in the
current folder.

*** New function `mh-version' displays version information about MH
and mh-e. Please use the output in bug reports.

*** `mh-quit' now burys the folder buffer and show buffer.


** New hooks and customization variables in mh-e 4.0

*** `mh-pick-mode-hook': new hook called by new mode `mh-pick-mode'.
The pick buffer didn't used to have its own mode. Another advantage of
`mh-pick-mode' is that `C-h m' works in the pick buffer.

*** `mail-citation-hook': new variable for supercite.

*** `mh-refile-msg-hook': new hook called by `mh-refile-msg' (and
`mh-refile-or-write-again' when refiling).

*** `mh-msg-folder-hook': new hook used by `mh-refile-msg' and
`mh-to-fcc' to provide a default folder for user prompt.

*** `mh-show-hook': new hook called by `mh-show'.

*** `mh-delete-msg-hook': new hook called by `mh-delete-msg'.

*** `mh-show-mode-hook': new hook called by new mode `mh-show-mode'
for `show-' buffers.

*** `mh-comp-formfile': new variable so can customize `components'
file.

*** `mh-sortm-args': new variable, a list of extra arguments to be
passed to sortm by `mh-sort-folder'. Give an argument to
`mh-sort-folder' to suppress this behavior.

*** `mh-send-prog': new variable so can customize name of `send'
program in case of name conflicts.

*** `mh-scan-prog': new variable so can customize name of `scan'
program to generate custom effects.

*** `mh-inc-prog': new variable so can customize name of `inc' program
to do fancy management of incoming messages.

*** `mh-forwarded-letter-subject': new function used by `mh-forward'
to compute the Subject line of the new message. It is a small function
which can be replaced by the user for customization. Uses the new
variable `mh-forward-subject-format', which allows some simple
customizations without rewriting even `mh-forwarded-letter-subject'.

*** `mh-new-draft-cleaned-headers': new variable, header lines removed
by `mh-edit-again' and `mh-extract-rejected-mail' before offering a
message as a new draft.

*** `mh-signature-file-name': new variable used by
`mh-insert-signature' to so can customize name of the file to insert.

*** `mh-read-address': new function called to read all To: and Cc:
addresses.

*** `mh-msg-folder-hook': new hook used by `mh-refile-msg' and
`mh-to-fcc' to provide a default folder for user prompt.


** Key binding changes in mh-e 4.0

*** `,' runs new function `mh-header-display'. It is like `.' but it
displays *all* the headers.

*** `M-#' runs the new function `mh-delete-seq'. One used to have to
type `C-u M-%' to delete a sequence.

*** `<' no longer does `mh-first-msg', but `M->' now does
`mh-last-msg'. This allows first and last to be consistent (`>' was
taken) and is more likely to be discovered by chance anyway.

*** `M-d' runs `mh-redistribute', `r' runs `mh-reply' (on the theory
that the more commonly used function should be easier to type, and the
obscure action of redistributing can be harder to type).

*** `M-o' changed to `C-o' (`mh-write-msg-to-file'). It was
interfering with arrow keys for some people.

*** `M-n' now runs `mh-store-msg' (formerly `mh-unshar-msg').

*** `b' no longer runs `mh-quit'; use `q' instead. `b' may be used in
a future version for something else.


** Minor improvements to mh-e 4.0

*** The mh-e code is now divided into multiple Emacs Lisp files, so it
starts up faster because Emacs doesn't have to load all of it at once.
(This change also makes it easier for the maintainer to manage
things.)

*** When searching for the directory containing the MH programs,
search the user's PATH in addition to the built-in directories, to
increase the chance of finding the MH programs.

*** The subject for a forwarded message no longer has ugly square
brackets around it.

*** The name of the folder is no longer appears twice in the show
buffer mode line.

*** When typing a folder name in the minibuffer, parent folders
complete to the trailing slash (/), for easier typing of subfolders.

*** The folder buffer mode name changed from `mh-e scan' or `mh-e
show' to `MH-Folder', which makes the hook name easier to guess. Added
`mh-showing' to `minor-mode-alist' so there is still an indication in
the mode line of whether messages will be shown automatically.

*** `mh-rename-seq' does completion on the old sequence name.

*** If called by a user who has never used MH on this system before,
mh-e runs the MH program `install-mh' to get them set up.

*** Undo history for previous messages is not kept to avoid wasting
memory.

*** The internal temp buffer used by mh-e has `buffer-offer-save'
explicitly nil. This change benefits people who change the
`buffer-offer-save' default.


** Bug fixes to mh-e 4.0

*** `mh-to-field': don't bomb if no To: field.

*** `mh-get-new-mail': restore annotations, e.g., cur, even if no new
mail.

*** `mh-rename-seq': verify that the new seq name was accepted by
`mark' before updating state.

*** `mh-internal-seq': the Previous sequence is not notated, since it
would notate everything scanned.

*** `mh-read-draft': don't call `find-file-noselect' so an
`auto-mode-alist' doesn't trigger `mh-letter-mode-hook' twice. Faster,
too.

*** `mh-show': If user moves onto a message that doesn't exist, don't
leave the cursor in the show pane.

*** `mh-delete-scan-msgs': use `equal', not `=', on the result of
`mh-get-msg-num', since it may be nil.

*** `mh-get-field': do anchored search so searching for `reply-to:'
doesn't find `in-reply-to:'.

*** `mh-widen': do nothing if not narrowed.

*** `mh-clean-message-header': find end of headers even if no body.
