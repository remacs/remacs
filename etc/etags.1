.SH DESCRIPTION
The \|\fBetags\fP\| program is used to create a tag table file, in a format
understood by
.BR emacs ( 1 )\c
\&; the \|\fBctags\fP\| program is used to create a similar table in a
format understood by
.BR vi ( 1 )\c
\&.  Both forms of the program understand
the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java, Fortran, Ada, Cobol, Erlang,
LaTeX, Emacs Lisp/Common Lisp, makefiles, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Postscript,
Python, Prolog, Scheme and
most assembler\-like syntaxes.
Both forms read the files specified on the command line, and write a tag
table (defaults: \fBTAGS\fP for \fBetags\fP, \fBtags\fP for
\fBctags\fP) in the current working directory.
Files specified with relative file names will be recorded in the tag
table with file names relative to the directory where the tag table
resides.  Files specified with absolute file names will be recorded
with absolute file names.  Files generated from a source file\-\-like
a C file generated from a source Cweb file\-\-will be recorded with
the name of the source file.
The programs recognize the language used in an input file based on its
file name and contents.  The \fB\-\-language\fP switch can be used to force
parsing of the file names following the switch according to the given
language, overriding guesses based on filename extensions.
.SH OPTIONS
Some options make sense only for the \fBvi\fP style tag files produced
by ctags;
\fBetags\fP does not recognize them.
The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for long option names.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-append
Append to existing tag file.  (For \fBvi\fP-format tag files, see also
\fB\-\-update\fP.)
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-backward\-search
Tag files written in the format expected by \fBvi\fP contain regular
expression search instructions; the \fB\-B\fP option writes them using
the delimiter `\|\fB?\fP\|', to search \fIbackwards\fP through files.
The default is to use the delimiter `\|\fB/\fP\|', to search \fIforwards\fP
through files.
Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-\-declarations
In C and derived languages, create tags for function declarations,
and create tags for extern variables unless \-\-no\-globals is used.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-defines
Create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions
and enum constants, too.  This is the
default behavior for \fBetags\fP.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-no\-defines
Do not create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions
and enum constants.
This may make the tags file much smaller if many header files are tagged.
This is the default behavior for \fBctags\fP.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-globals
Create tag entries for global variables in C, C++, Objective C, Java,
and Perl.
This is the default behavior for \fBetags\fP.
.TP
.B \-G, \-\-no\-globals
Do not tag global variables.  Typically this reduces the file size by
one fourth.  This is the default behavior for \fBctags\fP.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIfile\fP, \fB\-\-include=\fIfile\fP
Include a note in the tag file indicating that, when searching for a
tag, one should also consult the tags file \fIfile\fP after checking the
current file.  This options is only accepted by \fBetags\fP.
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-ignore\-indentation
Don't rely on indentation as much as we normally do.  Currently, this
means not to assume that a closing brace in the first column is the
final brace of a function or structure definition in C and C++.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlanguage\fP, \fB\-\-language=\fIlanguage\fP
Parse the following files according to the given language.  More than
one such options may be intermixed with filenames.  Use \fB\-\-help\fP
to get a list of the available languages and their default filename
extensions.  The `auto' language can be used to restore automatic
detection of language based on the file name.  The `none'
language may be used to disable language parsing altogether; only
regexp matching is done in this case (see the \fB\-\-regex\fP option).
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-members
Create tag entries for variables that are members of structure-like
constructs in C++, Objective C, Java.
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-no\-members
Do not tag member variables.  This is the default behavior.
.TP
.B \-\-packages\-only
Only tag packages in Ada files.
.TP
\fB\-\-parse\-stdin=\fIfile\fP
May be used (only once) in place of a file name on the command line.
\fBetags\fP will read from standard input and produce tags marking them
as belonging to the file \fBFILE\fP.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fItagfile\fP, \fB\-\-output=\fItagfile\fP
Explicit name of file for tag table; overrides default \fBTAGS\fP or
\fBtags\fP.   (But ignored with \fB\-v\fP or \fB\-x\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIregexp\fP, \fB\-\-regex=\fIregexp\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-case\-regex=\fIregexp\fP
Make tags based on regexp matching for each line of the files
following this option, in addition to the tags made with the standard
parsing based on language.  When using \fB\-\-regex\fP, case is
significant, while it is not with \fB\-\-ignore\-case\-regex\fP. May
be freely intermixed with filenames and the \fB\-R\fP option.  The
regexps are cumulative, i.e. each option will add to the previous
ones.  The regexps are of the form:
.br
	\fB/\fP\fItagregexp\fP[\fB/\fP\fInameregexp\fP]\fB/\fP
.br

where \fItagregexp\fP is used to match the lines that must be tagged.
It should not match useless characters.  If the match is
such that more characters than needed are unavoidably matched by
\fItagregexp\fP, it may be useful to add a \fInameregexp\fP, to
narrow down the tag scope.  \fBctags\fP ignores regexps without a
\fInameregexp\fP.  The syntax of regexps is the same as in emacs.
.br
Here are some examples.  All the regexps are quoted to protect them
from shell interpretation.
.br

Tag the DEFVAR macros in the emacs source files:
.br
\fI\-\-regex\='/[ \\t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \\t(]+"\\([^"]+\\)"\/'\fP
.\"" This comment is to avoid confusion to Emacs syntax highlighting
.br

Tag VHDL files (this example is a single long line, broken here for
formatting reasons):
.br
\fI\-\-language\=none\ \-\-regex='/[\ \\t]*\\(ARCHITECTURE\\|\\
CONFIGURATION\\)\ +[^\ ]*\ +OF/'\ \-\-regex\='/[\ \\t]*\\
\\(ATTRIBUTE\\|ENTITY\\|FUNCTION\\|PACKAGE\\(\ BODY\\)?\\
\\|PROCEDURE\\|PROCESS\\|TYPE\\)[\ \\t]+\\([^\ \\t(]+\\)/\\3/'\fP
.br

Tag TCL files (this last example shows the usage of a \fItagregexp\fP):
.br
\fI\-\-lang\=none \-\-regex\='/proc[\ \\t]+\\([^\ \\t]+\\)/\\1/'\fP

.br
A regexp can be preceded by {\fIlang\fP}, thus restricting it to match
lines of files of the specified language.  Use \fBetags --help\fP to obtain
a list of the recognised languages.  This feature is particularly useful inside
\fBregex files\fP.  A regex file contains one regex per line.  Empty lines,
and those lines beginning with space or tab are ignored.  Lines beginning
with @ are references to regex files whose name follows the @ sign.  Other
lines are considered regular expressions like those following \fB\-\-regex\fP.
.br
For example, the command
.br
\fIetags \-\-regex=@regex.file *.c\fP
.br
reads the regexes contained in the file regex.file.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-no\-regex
Don't do any more regexp matching on the following files.  May be
freely intermixed with filenames and the \fB\-\-regex\fP option.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-typedefs
Record typedefs in C code as tags.  Since this is the default behaviour
of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-typedefs\-and\-c++
Generate tag entries for typedefs, struct, enum, and union tags, and
C++ member functions.  Since this is the default behaviour
of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-update
Update tag entries for \fIfiles\fP specified on command line, leaving
tag entries for other files in place.  Currently, this is implemented
by deleting the existing entries for the given files and then
rewriting the new entries at the end of the tags file.  It is often
faster to simply rebuild the entire tag file than to use this.
Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-vgrind
Instead of generating a tag file, write index (in \fBvgrind\fP format)
to standard output.  Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-no\-warn
Suppress warning messages about duplicate entries.  The \fBetags\fP
program does not check for duplicate entries, so this option is not
allowed with it.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-cxref
Instead of generating a tag file, write a cross reference (in
\fBcxref\fP format) to standard output.  Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-h, \-H, \-\-help
Print usage information.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print the current version of the program (same as the version of the
emacs \fBetags\fP is shipped with).
