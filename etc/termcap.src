#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ncurses.html>.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer.
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the
# 1023-byte string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where
# explicitly noted below.
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# CONTINUITY WITH HISTORICAL VERSIONS:
#
# The last /etc/termcap version maintained by John Kunze was 8.3, dated 8/5/94.
# Releases 9 and up are maintained by Eric Raymond as part of the ncurses
# project.
#
# This file contains all the capability information present in John Kunze's
# last version of the termcap master file, except as noted in the change 
# comments at end of file.  Some information about very ancient obsolete
# capabilities has been moved to comments.  Some all-numeric names of older
# terminals have been retired.
#
# The 9.1.0 version of this file was translated from a syntax-corrected copy of
# 8.3, then mechanically checked against 8.3 using Emacs Lisp code written for
# the purpose.  Unless the ncurses tic implementation and the Lisp code were
# making perfectly synchronized mistakes which I then failed to catch by
# eyeball, the translation was correct and perfectly information-preserving.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# Starting with version 9.0.0, the file is divided up into major sections
# (headed by lines beginning with "########") and minor sections (beginning
# with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency even if you don't
# use reorder).  Minor sections usually correspond to manufacturers or
# standard terminal classes.  Parenthesized words following manufacturer
# names are type prefixes or product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# Finally, because this file is released in both terminfo and termcap formats,
# most references to termcap names in comments are bracketed with colons (the
# termcap separator) so they can be distinguished from terminfo capability
# names.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	mono	suppress color support
#	rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
#	pp	Has a printer port which is used.
#	na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#	nam	No auto-margin - suppress am capability
#	mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	vb	Use visible bell (flash) rather than beep.
#
# To easily test a new terminal description, put it in $HOME/.termcap
# and programs will look there before looking in /etc/termcap.
# You can also setenv TERMPATH to a list of full pathnames (separated
# by spaces or colons) to be searched by tgetent() in the order listed.
# The TERMCAP environment variable is usually set to the termcap
# entry itself to avoid reading files when starting up a program.
#
# RELEASE 9 COMMENTS:
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages. 
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# I changed :MT: to :km: (the 4.4BSD name) everywhere.  I commented out some
# capabilities (EP, dF, dT, dV, kn, ko, ma, ml, mu, xr, xx) that are no longer
# used by BSD curses.
#
# Entries derived from XENIX use a termcap-extension set that showed up in
# several entries, notably those for scoansi, ibmpcx, lisa, trs16, fos, and
# the altos terminals.  Its signature is the use of GS/GE as an as/ae pair.
# This set of extensions and their translations are described in the extended
# comment at the end of this file.
#
# There is a second, smaller set of extensions used by AT&T terminals and
# also described in the trailing comment.
#
# Besides these and the terminals mentioned above, only the psterm variants,
# zen50, wsiris and minitel had unknown capabilities that weren't obviously
# garbled.
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, u0...u9.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equivalent to ANSI DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equivalent to VT100 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equivalent to ANSI CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string u9 should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for u9 will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (u7) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for ANSI/VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (u6) string must contain two scanf(3)-style 
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  The typical CPR value is \E[%d;%dR (on VT100/
# ANSI-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tac(1m), the terminfo action checker soon
# to be distributed with ncurses.
# 
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL:
#
# As the ANSI standard and variants take firmer hold, and as character-cell
# terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of this file
# is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for the
# new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, and vt100 up front in
# confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Manufacturer unknown' and `Utter unknowns', before the tribal wisdom 
# about them gets lost.
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## STANDARD AND SPECIAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and maker brands that are still
# quite common.
#

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.
# The last one, "other", is like unknown but it allows an escape from software
# that insists that a "real" unknown terminal is merely so far unspecified.

# Also deleted ich and ich1, as QModem up to 5.03 doesn't recognize these.

#### ANSI console types
#

# This entry is good for the 1.1.47 version of the Linux console driver.
#
# It assumes that you want A_PROTECT mapped to the alternate character set
# mode that permits IBM ROM characters to be displayed (this is the assumption
# used by ncurses version 1.9 and after, in order not to collide with the
# internationalization attribute values specified in the XSI Curses standard).
#
# We use \E11m for rmacs rather than \E12m so the acsc string can use the ROM
# graphics for control characters such as the diamond, up arrow and down-arrow.
# This trick could work with other Intel consoles like the att6386 and pc3.
#
# Note: there are numerous broken linux entries out there, which didn't screw
# up BSD termcap but hose ncurses's smarter cursor-movement optimization.
# One common pathology is an incorrect tab length of 4.  Also note that the 
# hpa=\E[%dG/vpa=\E[%dd capabilities seem not to be reliable.  To reproduce
# the bug, re-introduce them and run worm -T 200 212 from the ncurses
# test suite, save the trace, then worm -N -T 200 212.  Observe that the first
# run fails to properly delete some worm segments, then diff the trace files.

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward are collected here.  Older DEC terminals
# and micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details
# on the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64 may be found near the
# end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps 
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.
#

# Note that the xenl glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# xenl right on vt100. The correct way to handle xenl is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If xenl
# is on, am should be on too.
# 
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam 
# below.
# 
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
# 
# The vt100 uses rs2 and rf rather than is2/tbc/hts because the 
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be 
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches 
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.
#
# This is how the keypad gets assigned in Application Keypad mode.

# DEC VT100 with Advanced Video Option -- NOT DEC'S ENTRY!!!
# This may be used as an alternate vt102 entry; it's probably better than the
# stock one if you can live with XON/XOFF.  All the AVO gave you was smul/rmul.
# From: Doug Gwyn <gwyn@smoke.brl.mil> 25 Jan 93
# The following SET-UP modes are assumed for normal operation:
#	ANSI_MODE	AUTO_XON/XOFF_ON	NEWLINE_OFF	80_COLUMNS
#	WRAP_AROUND_ON
# Other SET-UP modes may be set for operator convenience or communication
# requirements; I recommend
#	SMOOTH_SCROLL	AUTOREPEAT_ON	BLOCK_CURSOR	MARGIN_BELL_OFF
#	SHIFTED_3_#
# Unless you have a graphics add-on such as Digital Engineering's VT640
# (and even then, whenever it can be arranged!) you should set
#	INTERLACE_OFF
# Hardware tabs are assumed to be set every 8 columns; they can be set up
# by the "reset", "tset", or "tabs" utilities (use vt100-x, 132 columns, for
# this).  I have included some compatible code in "rs" for the VT640 if you
# have one.  No delays are specified; use "stty ixon -ixany" to enable DC3/DC1
# flow control!
# Thanks to elsie!ado (Arthur David Olson) for numerous improvements.

# The VT520 is a monochrome text terminal capable of managing up to

# emulations (VT520, VT420, VT320, VT220, VT100, VT PCTerm, SCO Console)
# and ASCII emulations (WY160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 150/120, TVI 950,
# 925 910+, ADDS A2).  This terminfo data is for the ANSI emulations only.
#
# Terminal Set-Up is entered by pressing [F3], [Caps Lock]/[F3] or
# [Alt]/[Print Screen] depending upon which keyboard and which
# terminal mode is being used.  If Set-Up has been disabled or
# assigned to an unknown key, Set-Up may be entered by pressing
# [F3] as the first key after power up, regardless of keyboard type.

# The default 2621 turns off the labels except when it has to to 
# enable the function keys. If your installation prefers labels

# Note: there are newer ROMs for 2621's that allow you to set 
# strap A so the regular arrow keys xmit \EA, etc, as with the 
# 2645. However, even with this strap set, the terminal stops 
# xmitting if you reset it, until you unset and reset the strap!
# Since there is no way to set/unset the strap with an escape

#
# Qume was bought by Wyse, but still (as of early 1995) has its own support
# group and production division.
#
# Discontinued Qume models:
#
# The qvt101 and qvt102 listed here are long obsolete; so is the qvt101+
# built to replace them, and a qvt119+ which was a 101+ with available wide
# mode (132 columns).  There was a qvt103 which added vt100/vt131 emulations
# and an ANSI-compatible qvt203 that replaced it.  Qume started producing
# ANSI-compatible terminals with the qvt323 and qvt61.
#
# Current Qume models (as of February 1995):
#
# All current Qume terminals have ANSI-compatible operation modes.
# Qume is still producing the qvt62, which features emulations for other
# popular lines such as ADDS, and dual-host capabilities.  The qvt82 is
# designed for use as a SCO ANSI terminal.  The qvt70 is a color terminal
# with many emulatioms including Wyse370, Wyse 325, etc.  Their newest
# model is the qvt520, which is vt420-compatible.
#
# There are some ancient printing Qume terminals under `Daisy Wheel Printers'

# All the following entries until (but not including) wy100q are direct from

# I made two trivial syntax fixes in the wyse30 entry, added OTbs everywhere
# needed, and merged in OTug#1 entries (as indicated by the termcap version of
# their descriptions).
#
# Note: The wyse75, wyse85, and wyse99 have been discontinued.

#	   Although the Wyse 30 can support more than one attribute
#	it requires magic cookies to do so.  Many applications do not
#	function well with magic cookies.  The following terminfo uses
#	the protect mode to support one attribute (dim) without cookies.
#	If more than one attribute is needed then the wy30-mc terminfo
#	should be used.

#	The Wyse 350 is a Wyse 50 with color.
#	Unfortunately this means that it has magic cookies.
#	The color attributes are designed to overlap the reverse, dim and
#	underline attributes.  This is nice for monochrome applications
#	because you can make underline stuff green (or any other color)
#	but for true color applications it's not so hot because you cannot
#	mix color with reverse, dim or underline.
#	    To further complicate things one of the attributes must be
#	black (either the foreground or the background).  In reverse video
#	the background changes color with black letters.  In normal video
#	the foreground changes colors on a black background.  
#	    This terminfo uses some of the more advanced features of curses
#	to display both color and blink.  In the final analysis I am not
#	sure that the wy350 runs better with this terminfo than it does
#	with the wy50 terminfo (with user adjusted colors).

#	The Wyse 60 is like the Wyse 50 but with more padding.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#		rs1 -> set personality
#		rs2 -> set number of columns
#		rs3 -> set number of lines
#		is1 -> select the proper font
#		is2 -> do the initialization
#		is3 -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The Wyse 60's that have vt100 emulation are slower than the
#	older Wyse 60's.  This change happened mid-1987.
#	The capabilities effected are (dch1) (dl1) (il1) (ind) (ri)
#
#	The meta key is only half right.  This terminal will return the
#	high order bit set when you hit CTRL-function_key
#
#	It may be useful to assign two function keys with the
#	values  \E=(\s  look at old data in page 1
#	        \E=W,   look at bottem of page 1
#	where \s is a space ( ).
#
#	Note:
#	   The Wyse 60 runs faster when the XON/XOFF
#	   handshake is turned off.

#
#	The display memory may be used for either text or graphics.
#	When "Display Memory = Shared" the terminal will have more pages

# Extensive changes to c108 by arpavax:eric Feb 1982
# Some unknown person at SCO then translated it to terminfo.
#
# There seem to be a number of different versions of the C108 PROMS
# (with bug fixes in its Z-80 program).
# 
# The first one that we had would lock out the keyboard of you
# sent lots of short lines (like /usr/dict/words) at 9600 baud.
# Try that on your C108 and see if it sends a ^S when you type it.
# If so, you have an old version of the PROMs.
# 
# You should configure the C108 to send ^S/^Q before running this.
# It is much faster (at 9600 baud) than the c100 because the delays
# are not fixed.
# new status line display entries for c108-8p:
# is3 - init str #3 - setup term for status display - 
# set programmer mode, select window 2, define window at last 
# line of memory, set bkgnd stat mesg there, select window 0.
# 
# tsl - to status line - select window 2, home cursor, erase to 
# end-of-window, 1/2 bright on, goto(line#0, col#?)
# 
# fsl - from status line - 1/2 bright off, select window 0
# 
# dsl - disable status display - set bkgnd status mesg with 
# illegal window #
# 
# There are probably more function keys that should be added but 
# I don't know what they are.

# Concept 100:
# These have only window relative cursor addressing, not screen 
# relative. To get it to work right here, smcup/rmcup (which 
# were invented for the concept) lock you into a one page 
# window for screen style programs.
# 
# To get out of the one page window, we use a clever trick:
# we set the window size to zero ("\Ev    " in rmcup) which the 
# terminal recognizes as an error and resets the window to all 
# of memory.
# 
# This trick works on c100 but does not on c108, sigh.
# 
# Some tty drivers use cr3 for concept, others use nl3, hence 
# the delays on cr and ind below. This padding is only needed at 
# 9600 baud. One or the other is commented out depending on 
# local conventions.
# 
# 2 ms padding on rmcup isn't always enough. 6 works fine. Maybe 
# less than 6 but more than 2 will work.
# 
# Note: can't use function keys f7-f10 because they are 
# indistinguishable from arrow keys (!), also, del char and 
# clear eol use xon/xoff so they probably won't work very well.
# 
# Also note that we don't define insrt/del char/delline/eop/send 
# because they don't transmit unless we reset them - I figured 
# it was a bad idea to clobber their definitions.
# 
# The mc5 sequence changes the escape character to ^^ so that 
# escapes will be passed through to the printer. Only trouble 
# is that ^^ won't be - ^^ was chosen to be unlikely. 
# Unfortunately, if you're sending raster bits through to be 
# plotted, any character you choose will be likely, so we lose.
#
# \EQ"\EY(^W (send anything from printer to host, for xon/xoff) 
# cannot be # in is2 because it will hang a c100 with no printer 
# if sent twice.

# The f110 and f200 have problems with vi(1).  They use the ^V
# code for the down cursor key. When kcud1 is defined in terminfo
# as ^V, the Control Character Quoting capability (^V in insert mode)
# is lost! It cannot be remapped in vi because it is necessary to enter
# a ^V to to quote the ^V that is being remapped!!!
# 
# f110 users will have to decide whether
# to lose the down cursor key or the quoting capability. We will opt
# initially for leaving the quoting capability out, since use of VI
# is not generally applicable to most interactive applications
# 
# The same applies to f200 users, except that another option exists.
# This option has been chosen locally. It will not be distributed unless
# a user runs into this problem and requests assistance. Very few users,
# if any, should run into this problem. The local solution is in
# vifix.local.ti. The f200 has the ability to reprogram the down cursor
# key. The key is reprogrammed to ^J (linefeed). This value is remembered
# in non-volatile RAM, so powering the terminal off and on will not cause
# the change to be lost. The terminfo definition for the f200 is changed
# to identify kcud1 as ^J instead of ^V.

#### Harris (Beehive)
#
# Bletch.  These guys shared the Terminal Brain Damage laurels with Hazeltine.
# Their terminal group is ancient history now (1995) though the parent
# company is still in business.
#

# Beehive documentation is undated and marked Preliminary and has no figures
# so we must have early Superbee2 (Model 600, according to phone conversation
# with mfr.). It has proved reliable except for some missing padding
# (notably after \EK and nl at bottom of screen).
# 
# The key idea is that AEP mode is poison for cup & that US's in 
# the local memory should be avoided like the plague. That means 
# that the 2048 character local buffer is used as 25 lines of 80 
# characters, period. No scrolling local memory, folks. It also 
# appears that we cannot use naked INS LINE feature since it uses
# US. The sbi fakes il1 with an 80-space insert that may be too 
# slow at low speeds; also spaces get converted to \040 which is 
# too long for some programs (not vi).  DEL LINE is ok but slow.
# 
# The nl string is designed for last line of screen ONLY; cup to 
# 25th line corrects the motion inherent in scrolling to Page 1.
# 
# There is one understood bug. It is that the screen appears to
# pop to a new (blank) page after a nel, or leave a half-line 
# elipsis to a quad that is the extra 48 memory locations. The 
# data received is dumped into memory but not displayed.  Not to 
# worry if cup is being used; the lines not displayed will be, 
# whenever the cursor is moved up there. Since cup is addressed 
# relative to MEMORY of window, nothing is lost; but beware of 
# relative cursor motion (cuu1,cud1,cuf1,cub1). Recommended, therefore, 
# is setenv MORE -c .
# 
# WARNING: Not all features tested.
# 
# Timings are assembled from 3 sources. Some timings may reflect 
# SB2/Model 300 that were used if more conservative.
# Tested on a Model 600 at 1200 and 9600 bd.
# 
# The BACKSPACEkb option is cute. The NEWLINE key, so cleverly 
# placed on the keyboard and useless because of AEP, is made 
# into a backspace key. In use ESC must be pressed twice (to send)
# and sending ^C must be prefixed by ESC to avoid that wierd 
# transmit mode associated with ENTER key.
# 
# IF TERMINAL EVER GOES CATATONIC with the cursor buzzing across 
# the screen, then it has dropped into ENTER mode; hit 
# RESET--ONLINE--!tset.
# 
# As delivered this machine has a FATAL feature that will throw 
# it into that strange transmit state (SPOW) if the space bar is 
# hit after a CR is received, but before receiving a LF (or a 
# few others).
# 
# The circuits MUST be modified to eliminate the SPOW latch. 
# This is done by strapping on chip A46 of the I/O board; cut 
# the p.c. connection to Pin 5 and strap Pin 5 to Pin 8 of that 
# chip. This mod has been checked out on a Mod 600 of Superbee II.
# With this modification absurdly high timings on cr are 
# unnecessary.
# 
# NOTE WELL that the rear panel switch should be set to CR/LF, 
# not AEP!

# Kimtron ABM 85H added by Dual Systems.
# Some notes about the 85h entries:
# 1) there are several firmware revs of 85H in the world. Use o85h for
#    firmware revs prior to SP51
# 2) Make sure to use 85h entry if the terminal is in 85H mode and the
#    85e entry if it is in 920 emulation mode. They are incompatible in
#    some places and NOT software settable i.e., :is: can't fix change it)
# 3) In 85h mode, the arrow keys and special functions transmit when
#    the terminal is in dup-edit, and work only locally in local-edit.
#    Vi won't swallow `del char' for instance, but :vs: turns on
#    dup-edit anyway so that the arrow keys will work right. If the
#    arrow keys don't work the way you like, change :vs:, :ve:, and :is:.
#    920E mode does not have software commands to toggle between dup
#    and local edit, so you get whatever was set last on the terminal.
# 4) :vb: attribute is nice, but seems too slow to work correctly (\Eb<pad>\Ed)
# 5) Make sure `hidden' attributes are selected. If `embedded' attributes
#    are selected, the entries :sg@: and :ug@: should be removed.
# 6) auto new-line should be on (selectable from setup mode only)

# We run our terminals at 2400 baud, so there might be some timing problems at
# higher speeds. The major improvements in this model are the terminal now 
# scrolls down and insert mode works without redrawing the rest of the line
# to the right of the cursor. This is done with a bit of a kludge using the
# exit graphics mode to get out of insert, but it does not appear to hurt
# anything when using vi at least. If you have some users using act4s with

# It should work with any program using the old curses (e.g. it better
# not try to scroll, or cursor addressing won't work.  Also, you can't
# see the cursor.)

#### IBM PC and clones

# The pcplot IBM-PC terminal emulation program is really messed up. It is
# supposed to emulate a vt-100, but emulates the wraparound bug incorrectly,
# doesn't support scrolling regions, ignores add line commands, and ignores
# delete line commands. Consequently, the resulting behavior looks like a
# crude adm3a-type terminal.

# ever (most units sold); they can still be found gathering dust in closets
# everywhere.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

#### Bolt, Beranek & Newman (bbn)
#
# The BitGraph was a product of the now-defunct BBN Computer Corporation.
# The parent company, best known as the architects of the Internet, is
# still around.
#

# Entries for the BitGraph terminals.  The problem 
# with scrolling in vi can only be fixed by getting BBN to put 
# smarter scroll logic in the terminal or changing vi or padding 
# scrolls with about 500 ms delay.
#	
# I always thought the problem was related to the terminal 
# counting newlines in its input buffer before scrolling and 
# then moving the screen that much. Then vi comes along and 
# paints lines in on the bottom line of the screen, so you get 
# this big white gap.

#### Chromatics
#

# cg7900: Following is revised version. As I mentioned, I recompiled 
# curses in order to accomadate the large amount of definition.
# I have put the long strings in ti/te. Ti sets up a window 
# that is smaller than the screen, and puts up a warning message 
# outside the window. Te erases the warning message, puts the 
# window back to be the whole screen, and puts the cursor at just
# below the small window. A defined vs and ve to really turn 
# the cursor on and off, but I have taken this out since I don't 
# like the cursor being turned off when vi exits.

# The major problem with the Z29 is that it requires more 
# padding than the Z19. Once again, here's a little termcap 
# entry for it that will do the trick. 
# 
# The problem declaring an H19 to be synonomous with a Z29 is that
# it needs more padding. It especially loses if a program attempts
# to put the Z29 into insert mode and insert text at 9600 baud. It
# even loses worse if the program attempts to insert tabs at 9600
# baud. Adding padding to text that is inserted loses because in 
# order to make the Z29 not die, one must add so much padding that
# whenever the program tries to use insert mode, the effective 
# rate is about 110 baud.
# 
# What program would want to put the terminal into insert mode 
# and shove stuff at it at 9600 baud you ask?  
# 
# Emacs. Emacs seems to want to do the mathematically optimal 
# thing in doing a redisplay rather than the practical thing.
# When it is about to output a line on top of a line that is 
# already on the screen, instead of just killing to the end of 
# the line and outputing the new line, it compares the old line 
# and the new line and if there are any similarities, it 
# constructs the new line by deleting the text on the old line 
# on the terminal that is already there and then inserting new
# text into the line to transform it into the new line that is 
# to be displayed. The Z29 does not react kindly to this.
# 
# But don't cry for too long.... There is a solution. You can make
# a termcap entry for the Z29 that says the Z29 has no insert mode.
# Then Emacs cannot use it. "Oh, no, but now inserting into a 
# line will be really slow", you say. Well there is a sort of a
# solution to that too. There is an insert character option on 
# the Z29 that will insert one character. Unfortunately, it 
# involves putting the terminal into ansi mode, inserting the 
# character, and changing it back to H19 mode. All this takes 12 
# characters. Pretty expensive to insert one character, but it 
# works. Either Emacs doesn't try to use its inserting hack when 
# it's only given an insert character ability or the Z29 doesn't 
# require padding with this (the former is probably more likely, 
# but I haven't checked it out).

#### Synertek
#
# Bob Manson <manson@pattyr.acs.ohio-state.edu> writes (28 Apr 1995):
#
# Synertek used to make ICs, various 6502-based single-board process
# control and hobbyist computers, and assorted peripherals including a
# series of small inexpensive terminals (I think they were one of the
# first to have a "terminal-on-a-keyboard", where the terminal itself
# was only slightly larger than the keyboard).
#
# They apparently had a KTM-1 model, which I've never seen. The KTM-2/40
# was a 40x24 terminal that could connect to a standard TV through a
# video modulator.  The KTM-2/80 was the 80-column version (the 2/40
# could be upgraded to the 2/80 by adding 2 2114 SRAMs and a new ROM).
# I have a KTM-2/80 still in working order.  The KTM-2s had fully
# socketed parts, used 2 6507s, a 6532 as keyboard scanner, a program
# ROM and 2 ROMs as character generators. They were incredibly simple,
# and I've never had any problems with mine (witness the fact that mine
# was made in 1981 and is still working great... I've blown the video
# output transistor a couple of times, but it's a 2N2222 :-)
#
# The KTM-3 (which is what is listed in the terminfo file) was their
# attempt at putting a KTM-2 in a box (and some models came with a
# CRT). It wasn't much different from the KTM-2 hardware-wise, but the
# control and escape sequences are very different. The KTM-3 was always
# real broken, at least according to the folks I've talked to about it.
# 
# The padding in the entry is probably off--these terminals were very
# slow (it takes like 100ms for the KTM-2 to clear the screen...) And
# anyone with any sanity replaced the ROMs with something that provided
# a reasonable subset of VT100 functionality, since the usual ROMs were
# obviously very primitive... oh, you could get an upgraded ROM from
# Synertek for some incredible amount of money, but what hacker with an
# EPROM burner would do that? :)
#

# The Teleray terminals were all discontinued in 1992-93.  RI still services
# and repairs these beasts, but no longer manufactures them.  The Teleray
# people believe that all the types listed below are very rare now (1995).
# There was a newer line of Telerays (Model 7, Model 20, Model 30, and
# Model 100) that were ANSI-compatible.
#
# Note two things called "teleray".  Reorder should move the common one
# to the front if you have either.  A dumb teleray with the cursor stuck
# on the bottom and no obvious model number is probably a 3700.

######## OTHER OBSOLETE TYPES
#
# These terminals are *long* dead -- these entries are retained for
# historical interest only.

#### Obsolete non-ANSI software emulations
#

# CTRM terminal emulator
# 1. underlining is not allowed with colors: first, is is simulated by 
# black on white, second, it disables background color manipulations.
# 2. BLINKING, REVERSE and BOLD are allowed with colors,
# so we have to save their status in the static registers A, B and H
# respectively, to be able to restore them when color changes
# (because any color change turns off ALL attributes)
# 3. "enter_bold_mode" and "enter_reverse_mode" sequences alternates modes,
# rather then simply  entering them.  Thus we have to check the
# static register B and H to determine the status, before sending the 
# escape sequence.
# 4. sgr0 now must set the status of all 3 register (A,B,H) to zero
# and then reset colors
# 5. implementation of the protect mode would badly penalize the performance.
# we would have to use \E&bn sequence to turn off colors (as well as all
# other attributes), and keep the status of protect mode in yet another
# static variable.  If someone really need this mode, they would have to
# create another terminfo entry.
# 6. original color-pair is white on black.
# store the information about colors into static registers
# 7. set foreground color.  it performs the following steps.
#   1) turn off all attributes
#   2) turn on the background and video attribues that have been turned
#      on before (this information is stored in static registers X,Y,Z,A,B,H,D).
#   3) turn on foreground attributes
#   4) store information about foreground into U,V,W static registers
# 8. turn on background: similar to turn on foreground above

# The terminal has tabs, but I'm getting tired of fighting the braindamage. 
# If no tab is set or the terminal's in a bad mood, it glitches the screen
# around all of memory.  Note that return puts a blank ("a return character")
# in the space the cursor was at, so we use ^P return (and thus ^P newline for
# newline).  Note also that if you turn off pt and let Unix expand tabs,
# curses won't work (current version) because it doesn't turn off this bit,
# and cursor addressing sends a tab for row/column 9.  What a losing terminal!
# I have been unable to get tabs set in all 96 lines - it always leaves at
# least one line with no tabs in it, and once you tab through that line,
# it completely weirds out.

######## ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR
#
# Some non-curses applications get confused if both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an update using insert.
# These applications are technically correct; in both 4.3BSD termcap and
# terminfo, you're not actually supposed to specify both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# unless the terminal needs both.  This requirement is now rare; most ich
# sequences do not require previous smir, and most smir insert modes do not
# require ich1 before each character.
#
# For ncurses-based applications this is not a problem, as ncurses uses
# one or the other as appropriate but never mixes the two.  Therefore we
# have not corrected entries like `linux' and `xterm' that specify both.
# If you see doubled characters from these, use the linux-nic and xterm-nic
# entries that suppress ich/ich1.

######## ANSI/VT100/PC-TERM TERMINAL STANDARDS
#
# ANSI Standard (X3.64) Control Sequences for Video Terminals and Peripherals
# 
# Most of the content of this comment is adapted from a table prepared by
# Richard Shuford, based on a 1984 Byte article.  Terminfo correspondences
# and discussion of some terminfo-related issues have been added.
#
# The table is a complete list of the defined ANSI X.364 control sequences.
# In the main table, \E stands for an escape (\033) character, SPC for space.
# Pn stands for a single numeric parameter to be inserted in decimal ASCII.
# Ps stands for a list of such parameters separated by semicolons

#
# Notes:
#
# (1) There seems to be some confusion abroad between CHA and HPA.  Most
# `ANSI' terminals accept the CHA sequence, not the HPA. but terminfo calls
# the capability (hpa).
#
# (2) CHT corresponds to terminfo (tab).  Usually it has the value ^I.
# Occasionally (as on, for example, certain HP terminals) this has the HTJ
# value.
#
# (3) terminfo (nel) is usually \r\n rather than ANSI \EE.
#
# (4) CUP and HVP are identical in effect.  Some ANSI.SYS versions accept
# HVP, but always allow CUP as an alternate.
#
# (5) See the VT100 discussion for the meaning of the ED parameter.
# 
# (6) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept HPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUF for this function and ignore HPR
#
# (7) In SGR, the ANSI.SYS values for attributes are now nearly universal.
#
# (8) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept VPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUD for this function and ignore VPR.

# F      is a Final character in
#             an Escape sequence (F from 3/0 to 7/14 in the ASCII table)
#             a control sequence (F from 4/0 to 7/14)
# 
# Gs     is a graphic character appearing in strings (Gs ranges from

# 
# Ce     is a control represented as a single bit combination in the C1 set
#        of controls in an 8-bit character set
# 
# C0     the familiar set of 7-bit ASCII control characters
# 
# C1     roughly, the set of control characters available only in 8-bit systems.
#        This is too complicated to explain fully here, so read Jim Fleming's
#        article in the February 1983 BYTE, especially pages 214 through 224.
# 
# Fe     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that has an
#        equivalent representation in an 8-bit environment as a Ce-type
#        (Fe ranges from 4/0 to 5/15)
# 
# Fs     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that is
#        standardized internationally with identical representation in 7-bit
#        and 8-bit environments and is independent of the currently
#        designated C0 and C1 control sets (Fs ranges from 6/0 to 7/14)
# 
# I      is an Intermediate character from 2/0 to 2/15 (inclusive) in the

# 
# Pn     is a numeric parameter in a control sequence, a string of zero or
#        more characters ranging from 3/0 to 3/9 in the ASCII table
# 
# Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
#        with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
#        3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
#        3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11
# 
# Format Effectors versus Editor Functions
# 
# A format effector specifies how following output is to be displayed.
# An editor function allows you to modify the display.  Informally
# format effectors may be destructive; format effectors should not be.
# 
# For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the 
# cursor or equivalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
# create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
# overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
# format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
# nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
# left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
# be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
# overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
# mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
# its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
# return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.

# The complete document describing the standard,  "ANSI X3.64-1979:
# Additional Controls for Use with the American National Standard
# Code for Information Interchange," can be ordered for $13.50 (plus
# $4 postage) from

#      212/354-3300
# 
# It's best to read the full standard before using it. It also helps
# to have copies of the related standards "X3.4-1977: American
# National Standard Code for Information Interchange" (the ASCII
# standard) and "X3.41.1974: Code-Extension Techniques for Use with
# the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of American National Standard for

# 
# NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION
# 
# Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:
# 
#      CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
#      LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC
# 
# plus several private DEC commands.
# 
# Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:
# 
#      Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
#      Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
#      Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
#      Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
#      Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
#      Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J
# 
# The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control
# 
#      Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)
# 
# by transmitting the sequence
# 
#      Esc [ ? l ; Ps c
# 
# where Ps is a character that describes installed options.
# 
# The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
# Report) control
# 
#      Esc [ 6 n
# 
# The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence
# 
#      Esc [ Pl ; Pc R
# 
# where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).
# 
# The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.
# 
# NOTES ON `PC-TERM' COMPATIBILITY
#
# The MS-DOS ANSI.SYS driver has set the de-facto standard for attribute
# and color values in the SGR string.  These are as follows:
#
# 0	all attributes off
# 1	foreground bright
# 4	underscore on
# 5	blink on/background bright (not reliable with brown)
# 7	reverse-video
# 8	set blank (non-display)
# 10	set primary font
# 11	set first alternate font (on PCs, display ROM characters 1-31)
# 12	set second alternate font (on PCs, display IBM high-half chars)
#
#			Color attribute sets
# 3n	set foreground color       / 0=black, 1=red,     2=green, 3=brown,
# 4n	set background color       \ 4=blue,  5=magenta, 6=cyan,  7=white
# Bright black becomes gray.  Bright brown becomes yellow,
#	
# * Many VGA cards (such as the Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing
#   when you try to set a "bright brown" (yellow) background with attribute
#   5 (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).  A few displays
#   (including the System V console) support an attribute 6 that undoes this
#   braindamage.
#
# * Some older versions of ANSI.SYS have a bug that causes thems to require
#   ESC [ Pn k as EL rather than the ANSI ESC [ Pn K.

######## NONSTANDARD CAPABILITY TRANSLATIONS USED IN THIS FILE
#
# The historical termcap file entries were written primarily in 4.4BSD termcap.
# The 4.4BSD termcap set was substantially larger than the original 4.1BSD set,
# with the extension names chosen for compatibility with the termcap names
# assigned in System V terminfo.  There are some variant extension sets out
# there.  We try to describe them here.
#
# XENIX extensions:
#
# The XENIX extensions include a set of function-key capabilities as follows:
#
#       code	XENIX variable name	terminfo name	name clashes?
#	----	-------------------	-------------	-----------------------
#	CL	key_char_left
#	CR	key_char_right
#	CW	key_change_window			create_window
#	EN	key_end          	kend
#	HM	key_home		khome
#	HP	??
#	LD	key_delete_line  	kdl1
#	LF	key_linefeed     			label_off
#	NU	key_next_unlocked_cell
#	PD	key_page_down   	knp
#	PL	??
#	PN	start_print		mc5
#	PR	??
#	PS	stop_print		mc4
#	PU	key_page_up     	kpp		pulse
#	RC	key_recalc				remove_clock
#	RF	key_toggle_ref				req_for_input
#	RT	key_return      	kent
#	UP	key_up_arrow           	kcuu1   	parm_up_cursor
#	WL	key_word_left
#	WR	key_word_right
#
# The XENIX extensions also include the following character-set and highlight
# capabilities:
#
#	XENIX	terminfo	function
#	-----	--------	------------------------------
#	GS	smacs		start alternate character set
#	GE	rmacs		end alternate character set
#	GG			:as:/:ae: glitch (analogous to :sg:/:ug:)
#	bo	blink		begin blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	be			end blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	bb			blink glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	it	dim		begin dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ie			end dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ig			dim glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#
# XENIX also supposedly uses the following forms-drawing capabilities:
#
#	single	double type
#	------	------	-------------
#	gv	GV	vertical line (|)
#	gh	GH	horizontal line (-)
#	g1	G1	top right corner
#	g4	G4	bottom right corner (_|)
#	g2	G2	top left corner
#	g3	G3	bottom left corner (|_)
#	gd	GD	down-tick character (T)
#	gl	GL	left-tick character (-|)
#	gr	GR	right-tick character (|-)
#	gc	GC	middle intersection (-|-)
#	gu	GU	up-tick character (_|_)
#
# However, there is some confusion about case.  The scoansi entry uses
# mixed-case versions of these, and the historical ibmpcx, lisa, trs16, and fos
# entries have only the uppercase versions.  Accordingly, the ncurses tools
# don't try to translate these.
#
# AT&T Extensions:
#
# The old AT&T 5410, 5420, 5425, pc6300plus, 610, and s4 entries used a set of
# nonstandard capabilities.  Its signature is the KM capability, used to name
# some sort of keymap file.  EE, BO, CI, CV, XS, DS, FL and FE are in this
# set.  Comments in the original, and a little cross-checking with other AT&T
# documentation, seem to establish that BO=:mr: (start reverse video), DS=:mh:
# (start dim), XS=:mk: (secure/invisible mode), EE=:me: (end highlights),
# FL=:LO: (enable soft labels), FE=:LF: (disable soft labels), CI=:vi: (make
# cursor invisible), and CV=:ve: (make cursor normal).
#
# TC Extensions:
#
# There is a set of extended termcaps associated with something
# called the "Terminal Control" or TC package created by MainStream Systems,
# Winfield Kansas.  This one also uses GS/GE for as/ae, and also uses
# CF for civis and CO for cvvis.  Finally, they define a boolean :ct:
# that flags color terminals.

#
# 9.7.0 (Tue May  9 18:03:12 EDT 1995):
#	* Added vt320-k3, rsvidtx from the Emacs termcap.dat file.  I think

#	* Some commented-out caps in long entries come back in, my code 
#	  for computing string-table lengths had a bug in it.
#	* pcansi series modified to fit comm-program reality better.
#
######## REORDER
#
# Older termcap distributions featured a kluge called `reorder' intended to
# time-optimize access to selected terminals by moving them to the front of
# the file.  This is obsolete under terminfo, but for completeness's sake
# we give a reorder script generator here (strip off the leading #s to use).
#
#: mkreorder --  generate script to optimize access to given terminal types
#:
#: entries named on command line will be sorted to the front in reverse order
#echo "ed -- termcap <<EOF"
