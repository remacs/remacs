This directory contains the files needed to build Emacs on the Mac OS
8/9 and Mac OS X.  Many of the major features of the Unix version are
supported: multiple frames, colors, scroll bars, menu bars, use of the
mouse, fontsets, international characters, input methods, and coding
systems.

Mac OS specific support includes document drag-and-drop in the Finder,
transfer of text to and from other applications via the clipboard, and
sending AppleScript commands to other applications from Emacs.

The following are not supported on Mac OS 8/9 : unexec (dump-emacs),
asynchronous subprocesses (start-process), and networking
(open-network-stream).  These features work fine on Mac OS X.

There is basic support for synchronous subprocesses (call-process) on
Mac OS 8/9 although Unix commands that are used will need to be
ported.

Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 6 or MPW-GM (August 2001) can be used to
build Emacs on the Mac OS 8/9.  On Mac OS X, Emacs can be built using
the Developer Tools.  See the INSTALL file in this directory for
instructions on building Emacs.

Binary distributions will be available in

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mac/emacs/

Read the Mac OS section of the on-line help to find out about how to
use Emacs on the Mac.

A number of things do not work yet:

+ On Mac OS X, environment variables are not set up correctly when
  Emacs is started from the Finder.

+ Emacs does not respond correctly to C-g when it is not reading
  input.

+ No image support yet.

+ There is no mouse-2 and mouse-3 emulation yet.

If your Mac is connected to the Internet, report bugs by typing `M-x
report-emacs-bug' or by choosing the entry `Send Bug Report...'  in
the `Help' menu.  This will send the bug report to the address
emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org.
