* BUILDING EMACS ON MAC OS X

You should be able to build Emacs on Mac OS X by typing the following
commands at the top-level directory after the source distribution is
un-tarred.

  ./configure
  make
  make install

The last step must be performed as root.

If you have X Window installed, you need to type `./configure
--without-x' instead of `./configure'.

You can type `make bootstrap' instead of `make' to rebuild everything,
including byte-compiling the Lisp files.

If you have not installed the GNU texinfo package on your system, the
build will complain that makeinfo cannot be found.  Instructions for
installing the GNU texinfo package are given below.  Alternatively,
you can type `make -k' instead of `make' and safely ignore the error
messages and use the existing info files.

After Emacs is installed, you can run it by typing `emacs -nw' from a
terminal (make sure your path contains /usr/local/bin) or by
double-clicking on mac/Emacs.app in the Finder.  At present,
command-line options cannot be passed to Emacs running under the Aqua
GUI.  This should soon be fixed.

To use colors in a terminal, put the following lines in the file
~/.termcap and log in again.

To build a binary distribution of Emacs for Mac OS X, run the shell
script make-bin-dist in the `mac' directory.  This will create a file
emacs-21.xx.yy-mac-bin.tar.gz.

To install the binary distribution, untar the file and run the shell
script osx-install in its top-level directory.

To build the `info' files, you need to install the texinfo software.

To install from source, obtain texinfo-4.2.tar.gz from ftp.gnu.org or
a mirror.  Un-tar it, enter its directory and type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

The last step needs to be performed as root.

You may also like to install ispell, which will allow you to use
ispell and flyspell-mode.  To install ispell from source, you first
need to install GNU textutils.

To do so, download textutils-2.0.tar.gz from ftp.gnu.org or a mirror.
Un-tar it, enter its directory, type

  ./configure --host=powerpc-apple-bsd
  make
  make install
    
Again, the last step needs to be performed as root.  Note that if you
run `make check', the test for `pr' will fail.

Get and un-tar ispell-3.2.06.tar.gz.  Look for it here:

  http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html

Go into its directory, type

  cp local.h.samp local.h

Add a line `#define TERMLIB ""' to the end of local.h.

Set the environment variable TMPDIR to an existing directory.  For
example since `/tmp' exists on my machine and I am using `bash', I
typed

  export TMPDIR=/tmp

Run `make' and `make install', the latter as root.


* BUILDING EMACS ON MAC OS 8/9

You can use either Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 6 or MPW-GM (Aug. 2001)
to build Emacs.  MPW-GM can be downloaded free of charge from Apple.

In either case, you will need MPW-GM to build the make-docfile utility
and to generate the doc string file DOC.

### IMPORTANT ### You can use StuffIf Expander to decompress and untar
the distribution.  However, you *must* set the radio button in the
Preferences->Cross Platform->Convert text files to Macintosh format to
"Never".  Otherwise the compiled Lisp files will be corrupted.

(Optional) A subset of the fonts from the GNU intlfonts-1.2
distribution converted to NFNT format can be obtained from

  ftp://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/pub/mac-emacs/GNU-fonts.smi.bin

To build Emacs in the MPW Shell, simply set the directory to
...:emacs:mac: and build the target Emacs of the make file
makefile.mpw.  I.e., execute the commands

  make Emacs -f makefile.MPW > Emacs.MakeScript
  Emacs.MakeScript

To build Emacs using CodeWarrior, start up the CodeWarrior IDE, choose
File->Import Project...  and select the file cw6-mcp.xml.  When
prompted to save the project, navigate to same directory as the file
cw6-mcp.xml, name the project emacs-cw6.mcp, and save it there.  Then
choose Project->Make.  Note that this does not build the DOC file.  To
do so, use MPW and build the target "Doc" in makefile.MPW.

Once built, the Emacs application (Emacs CW or Emacs MPW) can be
launched where it is created.

To build an optimized version of Emacs in CodeWarrior, change the
value in the Emacs Settings->Code Generation->Global Optimization
dialog.  To build a version for profiling, check the Profiler
Information box in the Emacs Settings->Code Generation->PPC Processor
dialog and include the Profiler PPC.Lib library.

* NOTES

Emacs should build and run on a PowerMac running Mac OS 8.6 - 10.1.

You will need around 100 MB of disk space for the source files and
intermediate files.

It will not run on machines running Mac OS 8/9 with more than 256 MB
of physical or virtual memory.  It does not have this restriction when
it is run under Mac OS X.  But the usual 128MB buffer limit of a
32-bit Emacs still exists.

Under Mac OS 8/9, there is no support for building the LEIM directory.
However, it can be built on Mac OS X or another platform and
transferred to the Mac.

On Mac OS 8/9, to use the same icon as when Emacs is built on Windows
NT, define GNU_ICON in mac/src/Emacs.r.  Currently Emacs uses a
generic application icon on the Mac OS X.  A better looking one is
coming soon.


Enjoy!
