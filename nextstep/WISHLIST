  Wish list for the "NS" OS X Emacs port
  --------------------------------------

    Note: This document is written using "org-mode", a plain-text
    format supporting outlines.  To expand a heading, press TAB.  To
    expand all headings and subheadings, press S-TAB until Emacs
    responds "SHOW ALL".

* Introduction

This is a wishlist for future development of the "NS" Emacs user
interface whose primary use is the official Emacs version on OS X.

This list should be seen as a complement to the bug- and wishlist on
[[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package%3Demacs][debbugs]], the Emacs bug tracker.

* Missing features

This sections contains features found in other official Emacs ports.

** Support for "xwidget"

Emacs 25 has support for "xwidgets", a system to include operating
system components into an Emacs buffer.  The components range from
simple buttons to "webkit" (effectively, a web browser).

Currently, "xwidget" only works for the "gtk+" framework but it is
designed to be compatible with multiple Emacs ports.

** Respect `frame-inhibit-implied-resize'

When the variable `frame-inhibit-implied-resize' is non-nil, frames
should not be resized when operations like changing font or toggling
the tool bar is performed.

Unfortunately, the tool bar (and possible other operations) always
resize the frame.

** Support `proced' (implement `process-attributes')

Unfortunately, a user-level process like Emacs does not have the
privileges to get information about other processes under OS X.

There are other ways to do this:

 1) Spawn "ps" and parse the output ("ps" has superuser privileges).

 2) Sign Emacs as part of the distribution process.

 3) Ask the user to self-sign Emacs, if this feature is of interest.

Anders Lindgren <andlind@gmail.com> has implemented
`process-attributes' for OS X -- which currently only work when
running Emacs as root.

[[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/02/manage-processes-with-proced/][See this article by Bozhidar Batsov for an overview of Proced.]]

** Tooltip properties

Tooltip properties like the background color and font are hard wired,
even though Emacs allow a user to customize such features.

* New features

This section contains features unique to the NS and/or OS X.

** PressAndHold for writing accented character

On OS X, many application supports the press and hold pattern to
invoke a menu of accented characters. (See example at [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201586][Apple]].)

Currently, this doesn't work in Emacs.

Note that "ns-win.el" explicitly disables this.

Note: This feature might not be allowed to be implemented until also
implemented in Emacs for a free system.

** Floating scroll bars

In modern OS X applications, the scroll bar often float over the
content, and is invisible unless actually used.  This makes user
interface less cluttered and more area could be used to contain text.

With floating scroll bars, the user interface would look like it does
when they are disabled today.  However, they will be made visible when
a scroll action is initiated, e.g. by putting two fingers on a
trackpad.

Note: This feature might not be allowed to be implemented until also
implemented in Emacs for a free system.

* Features from the "mac" port

This section contains features available in the "mac" Emacs port.

As the "mac" port (as of this writing) isn't an official Emacs port,
it might contain features not following the FSF rule "must exist on
free systems".

The "mac" port is based on the Emacs 22 C-based Carbon interface. It
has been maintained in parallel to the official Cocoa-based NS
interface. The Carbon interface has been enhanced, and a number of the
features of that interface could be implemented NS.

** Smooth scrolling -- maybe not a good idea

Today, by default, scrolling with a trackpad makes the text move in
steps of five lines. (Scrolling with SHIFT scrolls one line at a
time.)

The "mac" port provides smooth, pixel-based, scrolling.  This is a very
popular features.  However, there are drawbacks to this method: what
happens if only a fraction of a line is visible at the top of a
window, is the partially visible text considered part of the window or
not? (Technically, what should `window-start' return.)

An alternative would be to make one-line scrolling the default on NS
(or in Emacs in general).

Note: This feature might not be allowed to be implemented until also
implemented in Emacs for a free system.

** Mouse gestures

The "mac" port defines the gestures `swipe-left/right/up/down',
`magnify-up/down', and `rotate-left/right'.

It also binds the magnification commands to change the font
size. (This should be not be done in a specific interface, instead
Emacs should do this binding globally.)

Note: This feature might not be allowed to be implemented until also
implemented in Emacs for a free system.

** Synthesize bold fonts

* Open issues

This section contains issues where there is an ongoing debate.

** Key bindings of CMD and ALT

Currently in the "ns" port, ALT is bound to Meta and CMD is bound to
Super -- allowing the user to use typical OS X commands like CMD-A to
mark everything.

Unfortunately, when using an international keyboard, you can't type
normal characters like "(" etc.

There are many alternative key bindings. One solution is to bind CMD
to Meta and pass ALT to the system.  In fact, this is what Emacs did up
to, and including, version 22.  Also, this is how the "mac" port binds
the keys.

One could envision asymmetrical variants as well, however, this is
inappropriate for the default setting.

See the discussion on emacs-devel [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-12/msg01575.html][part 1]] and [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-01/msg00008.html][part 2]].

* Bugs

This sections contains a small selection of bugs which are hard to
fix.  For other bugs, see the official bug tracker debbugs.gnu.org.

** Incorrect translation of Super modifier with Ctrl or Meta on OS X

When pressing `M-s-a', Emacs replies "M-s-å is undefined".  What
happened is a mix of Emacs view that Meta and Super has been pressed,
and OS X view that ALT-a should yield "å".

The bug reports suggests two different patched, unfortunately, none
work properly.  For example:

   Use a Swedish keyboard layout

   (setq ns-alternate-modifier nil)

   "CMD-ALT-9"

Today, this correctly yields that s-] is undefined.  With the either
of the two patches, Emacs responds that s-9 was pressed.

More investigation is needed to fix this problem.

** Toggline the toolbar in fullheight or maximized modes

The toolbar, in the NS interface, is not considered part of the text
area.  When it is toggled, the Emacs frame change height accordingly.

Unfortunately, this also occurs when the frame is in fullheight or
maximized modes (N.B. this is not the same as "fullscreen").  The
effect is that the full frame size either increases (stretching down
below the lower edge of the screen) or decreases (leaving space
between the lower edge of the frame and the lower edge of the screen).

A better solution would be for the frame to retain its size,
i.e. change the text area.

This is related to the `frame-inhibit-implied-resize' issue.

* Internal development features

** Regression test system (or at least a checklist)

Today, after each change to the user interface, Emacs must be manually
tested.  Often, small details are overlooked ("Oh, I didn't test
toggling the tool-bar in one of the full screen modes, when multiple
frame were open -- silly me.")

It would be an enormous help if this could be tested automatically.
Many features are generic, however, the NS interface provides a number
of unique features.

*** Existing packages

Note that there is a generic UI test named "[[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug%3D21415#284][frame-test.el]]".  The NS
interface pass this, with the exception of two toolbar related
errors.

*** Anders frame test

Anders Lindgren <andlind@gmail.com> has implmented some (very basic)
tests for full screen, toolbar, and auto-hiding the menu bar.

** Make sure all build variants work

Emacs can be build in a number of different ways.  For each feature,
consider if is really is "NS" specific, or if it should be applied to
all build versions.

- With the "NS" interface.  This is the normal way to build Emacs on
  OS X.

- With the "X11" interface.  On OS X, this is mainly of interest to
  developers of Emacs to get a "reference" interface implementations.
  However, it might be of interest for people working remotely, as X11
  applications can be used over a network connection.

- Console only.
