	Support indirection for all shr-tag-* calls

	The 'shr-external-rendering-functions' variable was previously only
	honored in the shr-descend function, now all direct calls to the
	shr-tag-* functions have been replaced by a call to
	'shr-indirect-call' which tries using an alternative rendering
	function first.

	* lisp/net/shr.el (shr-indirect-call): New helper function.
	(shr-descend, shr-tag-object, shr-tag-video):
	(shr-collect-extra-strings-in-table): Fix callers to call via

	- Fix a couple of warnings in legacy backend.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): Use new
	flymake-diag-region.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc-legacy-flymake): Do error when no
	buffer-file-name or not writable.
	(flymake-proc-legacy-flymake)
	(flymake-proc-simple-cleanup): Don't reference flymake-last-change-time

2017-10-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Speed up (format "%s" STRING) and the like

	Although the Lisp manual said that ‘format’ returns a
	newly-allocated string, this was not true for a few cases like
	(format "%s" ""), and fixing the documentation to allow reuse of
	arguments lets us improve performance in common cases like
	(format "foo") and (format "%s" "foo") (Bug#28625).
	* doc/lispref/strings.texi (Formatting Strings):
	* etc/NEWS:
	Say that the result of ‘format’ might not be newly allocated.
	* src/callint.c (Fcall_interactively):
	* src/dbusbind.c (XD_OBJECT_TO_STRING):
	* src/editfns.c (Fmessage, Fmessage_box):
	* src/xdisp.c (vadd_to_log, Ftrace_to_stderr):
	Just use Fformat or Fformat_message, as that’s simpler and no
	longer makes unnecessary copies.
	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Remove last argument, as it
	is no longer needed: all callers now want it to behave as if it
	were true.  All remaining callers changed.  Make this function
	static again.  Simplify the function now that we no longer
	need to worry about whether the optimization is allowed.

2017-10-04  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Fontify untyped function declarations in C Mode correctly.

	Also correct two bugs where deleting WS at a BOL could leave an untyped
	function declaration unfontified.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-find-decl-spots): Don't set the flag
	"top-level" when we're in a macro.
	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Recognize top-level "foo(bar)" or "foo()" in C
	Mode as a implicitly typed function declaration.
	(c-just-after-func-arglist-p): Don't get confused by "defined (foo)" inside a
	macro.  It's not a function plus arglist.

	defvar.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-mode.el (c-fl-decl-end): After c-forward-declarator, move

	(getcjmp): Define to current thread's 'm_getcjmp'.
	* src/thread.c (maybe_reacquire_global_lock): Switch to main
	thread, since this is called from a SIGINT handler, which always
	runs in the context of the main thread.
	* src/lisp.h (sys_jmp_buf, sys_setjmp, sys_longjmp): Move the
	definitions before thread.h is included, as thread.h now uses
	sys_jmp_buf.
	* src/keyboard.c (getcjmp): Remove declaration.
	(read_char): Don't call maybe_reacquire_global_lock here.
	(handle_interrupt): Call maybe_reacquire_global_lock here, if

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Flymake backends can report multiple times per check

	Rewrote a significant part of the Flymake backend API.  Flymake now
	ignores the return value of backend functions: a function can either
	returns or errors.  If it doesn't error, a backend is no longer
	constrained to call REPORT-FN exactly once.  It may do so any number
	of times, cumulatively reporting diagnostics.  Flymake keeps track of
	outdated REPORT-FN instances and disconsiders obsolete reports.
	Backends should avoid reporting obsolete data by cancelling any
	ongoing processing at every renewed call to the backend function.

	Consolidated flymake.el internal data structures to require less
	buffer-local variables.  Adjusted Flymake's mode-line indicator to the
	new semantics.

	Adapted and simplified the implementation of elisp and legacy
	backends, fixing potential race conditions when calling backends in
	rapid succession.

	Added a new test for a backend that calls REPORT-FN multiple
	times.  Simplify test infrastructure.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-elisp.el (flymake-elisp-checkdoc)
	(flymake-elisp-byte-compile): Error instead of returning nil
	if not in emacs-lisp-mode.
	(flymake-elisp--byte-compile-process): New buffer-local variable.

	(flymake-proc--processes): Remove.
	(flymake-proc--process-filter): Don't bind

	Flymake uses proper idle timers

	Also, flymake-no-changes-timeout can be set to nil to disable
	automatic periodic checks.  But even in that situation the idle timer

	Don't use it.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Fix three Flymake bugs when checking C header files

	The first of these problems is longstanding: if an error-less B.h is
	included from error-ridden A.h, flymake's legacy parser will panic
	(and disable itself) since it sees a non-zero exit for a clean file.
	To fix this, recommend returning 'true' in the documentation for the
	check-syntax target.

	Another problem was introduced by the parser rewrite.  For error
	patterns spanning more than one line, point may be left in the middle
	of a line and thus render other patterns useless.  Those patterns were
	written for the old line-by-line parser.  To make them useful again,
	move to the beginning of line in those situations.

	The third problem was also longstanding and happened on newer GCC's:
	The "In file included from" prefix confused
	flymake-proc-get-real-file-name.  Fix this.

	Also updated flymake--diag-region to fallback to highlighting a full
	line less often.

	Add automatic tests to check this.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): Fix bug when patterns
	accidentally spans more than one line.  Don't create
	diagnostics without error messages.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	A couple of Flymake backends for emacs-lisp-mode

	Loading flymake-elisp.el doesn't setup flymake-mode to turn on
	automatically, but it affects emacs-lisp-mode-hook so that
	flymake-diagnostic-functions is setup with a suitable buffer-local
	value.  The variable flymake-diagnostic-funtions in every live
	emacs-lisp-mode buffer is also adjusted.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (top): Require flymake-elisp.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-elisp.el: New file.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Fancy Flymake mode-line construct displays status

	Imitates compilation-mode's mode-line a bit, and uses its faces.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Tweak Flymake commands flymake-goto-[next/prev]-error

	Add filters, useful for backends like the upcoming
	flymake-elisp-checkdoc backend, for example, which litters everything
	with low-priority notes.

	Also re-implement wraparound for flymake-goto-next-error. Manual
	mentions this, so it's probably a good idea to keep it.  Added a new
	customization variable flymake-wrap-around to control it.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-goto-prev-error)
	(flymake-goto-next-error): Accept FILTER argument.
	(flymake-wrap-around): New variable.

	Simplify Flymake logging and erroring

	Use display-warning and a dedicated *Flymake log* buffer.

	To ease readability, flymake log messages are now prefixed with a
	common prefix and the buffer that originated them.

	Work around deprecation of gtk_style_context_get_background_color

	* src/gtkutil.c (xg_check_special_colors): Replace call to
	gtk_style_context_get_background_color with its definition.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	New Flymake API variable flymake-diagnostic-functions

	Lay groundwork for multiple active backends in the same buffer.

	Backends are lisp functions called when flymake-mode sees fit.  They
	are responsible for examining the current buffer and telling
	flymake.el, via return value, if they can syntax check it.
	Backends should return quickly and inexpensively, but they are also
	passed a REPORT-FN argument which they may or may not call
	asynchronously after performing more expensive work.

	REPORT-FN's calling convention stipulates that a backend calls it with
	a list of diagnostics as argument, or, alternatively, with a symbol
	denoting an exceptional situation, usually some panic resulting from a
	misconfigured backend.  In keeping with legacy behaviour,
	flymake.el's response to a panic is to disable the issuing backend.

	The flymake--diag object representing a diagnostic now also keeps
	information about its source backend.  Among other uses, this allows
	flymake to selectively cleanup overlays based on which backend is
	updating its diagnostics.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el (flymake-proc--report-fn):
	New dynamic variable.
	(flymake-proc--process): New variable.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	More Flymake cleanup before advancing to backend redesign

	Diagnostics are reported for buffers, not necessarily files.  It’s the
	backend’s responsibility to compute the buffer where the diagnostic is
	applicable.  For now, this has to match the buffer where flymake-mode
	is active and which is at the origin of the backend call.

	flymake.el knows nothing about line/column diagnostics (except for
	backward-compatible flymake-ler-make-ler, which must yet be tested).
	It’s also the backend’s reponsibility to compute a BEG and END
	positions for the diagnostic in the relevant buffer.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): Convert LINE/COL to
	region here.  Check file buffer here.
	(flymake-proc--process-sentinel): Don’t kill output buffer if
	high enough log level.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-diag-region): Make this a utility
	function.  (flymake--highlight-line): Diagnostic has region now.
	(flymake-popup-current-error-menu): Don’t add file and line numbers to
	already this silly menu.  (flymake--fix-line-numbers): Remove.
	(flymake-report): No need to fix diagnostics here.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Protect Flymake's eager checks against commands like fill-paragraph

	If flymake-start-syntax-check-on-newline is t, check should start as
	soon as a newline is seen by after-change-functions.  But don't rush
	it: since the buffer state might not be final, we might end up with
	invalid diagnostic regions after some commands silently insert and
	delete newlines (looking at you, fill-paragraph).

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-after-change-function): Pass
	`deferred' to flymake--start-syntax-check.
	(flymake--start-syntax-check): Take optional `deferred' arg.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Flymake highlights GCC info/notes as detected by flymake-proc.el

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): Rewrite (using cl-loop) to
	honour more sophisticated flymake-proc-diagnostic-type-pred.
	(flymake-warning-re): Is now an obsolete alias for
	flymake-proc-diagnostic-type-pred.
	(flymake-proc-diagnostic-type-pred): Rename and augment from

	(flymake-diagnostic-types-alist): Simplify.
	(flymake-note): New overlay category.
	(flymake--lookup-type-property): Only lookup single keys, not lists.
	(flymake--diag-errorp): Rewrite.
	(flymake--highlight-line): Use flymake--lookup-type-property.

	* test/lisp/progmodes/flymake-tests.el
	(different-diagnostic-types): Rename from errors-and-warnings.
	Check notes.
	(flymake-tests--call-with-fixture): Use
	flymake-proc-diagnostic-type-pred.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Flymake checks file names before considering diagnostics

	The error patterns for gcc picked up errors for the Makefile itself,
	for example.  These shouldn't count as actual errors.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-report): Check
	matching file names.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Echo Flymake error messages when navigating errors interactively

	Perhaps binding M-n and M-p to flymake-goto-next-error and
	flymake-goto-prev-error also wouldn't be a bad idea.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-goto-next-error): Use
	target overlay's help-echo.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Add a new Flymake test for multiple errors and warnings

	* test/lisp/progmodes/flymake-tests.el
	(flymake-tests--call-with-fixture): Save excursion.
	(errors-and-warnings): New test.

	* test/lisp/progmodes/flymake-resources/errors-and-warnings.c:
	New test fixture.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Flymake warning face easier to distinguish

	A orange wavy underline is very hard to tell from a red wavy
	underline.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-warning): Change color to
	"deep sky blue"

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Flymake's flymake-proc.el parses column numbers from gcc/javac errors

	Column numbers are not a great way of marking diagnostic regions, but
	that's probably all that can be expected from the flymake-proc.el
	backend.  For now, try (end-of-thing 'sexp) to discover the
	diagnostic's end position.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el ()
	(flymake-proc-err-line-patterns): Also parse column numbers,
	if available, for gcc/javac warnings.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	New Flymake variable flymake-diagnostic-types-alist and much cleanup

	A new user-visible variable is introduced where different diagnostic
	types can be categorized.  Flymake backends can also contribute to
	this variable.  Anything that doesn’t match an existing error type
	is considered.

	The variable’s alists are used to propertize the overlays pertaining
	to each error type.  The user can override the built-in properties by
	either by modifying the alist, or by modifying the properties of a
	special "category" symbol, named by the `flymake-category' entry in
	the alist.

	The `flymake-category' entry is especially useful for, say, the author
	of foo-flymake-backend, who issues diagnostics of type :foo-note, that
	should behave like notes, except with no fringe bitmap:

	   (add-to-list 'flymake-diagnostic-types-alist
	                '(:foo-note
	                  . ((flymake-category . flymake-note)
	                     (bitmap . nil))))

	For essential properties like `severity', `priority', etc, a default
	value is produced.  Some properties like `evaporate' cannot be
	overriden.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake--diag): Rename from
	flymake-ler.
	(flymake-ler-make): Obsolete alias for flymake-diagnostic-make
	(flymake-ler-errorp): Rewrite using flymake--severity.
	(flymake--place-overlay): Delete.
	(flymake--overlays): Now a cl-defun with &key args.  Document.
	Use `overlays-at' if BEG is non-nil and END is nil.
	(flymake--lookup-type-property): New helper.
	(flymake--highlight-line): Rewrite.
	(flymake-diagnostic-types-alist): New API variable.
	(flymake--diag-region)

	(flymake--fix-line-numbers): Use flymake--diag-line.
	(flymake-goto-next-error): Pass :key to flymake-overlays

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): Use flymake-diagnostic-make.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Refactor Flymake tests in preparation for more tests

	Introduce a slightly more generic fixture macro.

	Also make flymake-tests.el friendlier to interactive runs, by not
	killing buffers visited by the user.

	* test/lisp/progmodes/flymake-tests.el
	(flymake-tests--call-with-fixture): New helper from
	flymake-tests--current-face.  Don't kill file buffers already
	being visited before the test starts.
	(flymake-tests--with-flymake): New macro.
	(flymake-tests--current-face): Delete.
	(warning-predicate-rx-gcc, warning-predicate-function-gcc)

	Use flymake-test--with-flymake.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Allow running Flymake tests from interactive sessions

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Flymake diagnostics now apply to arbitrary buffer regions

	Make Flymake UI some 150 lines lighter

	Strip away much of the original implementation's complexity in
	manipulating objects representing diagnostics as well as creating and
	navigating overlays.

	Lay some groundwork for a more flexible approach that allows for
	different classes of diagnostics, not necessarily line-based.
	Importantly, one overlay per diagnostic is created, whereas the
	original implementation had one per line, and on it it concatenated
	the results of errors and warnings.

	This means that currently, an error and warning on the same line are
	problematic and the warning might be overlooked but this will soon be
	fixed by setting appropriate priorities.

	Since diagnostics can highlight arbitrary regions, not just lines, the
	faces were renamed.

	Tests pass and backward compatibility with interactive functions is
	maintained, but probably any third-party extension or customization
	relying on more than a trivial set of flymake.el internals has stopped
	working.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): Use new flymake-ler-make
	constructor syntax.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (flymake-ins-after)

	(warning-predicate-function-gcc, warning-predicate-rx-perl)
	(warning-predicate-function-perl): Use face `flymake-warning'.

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Move symbols in flymake-proc.el to separate namespace

	Every symbol in this flymake now starts with the prefix flymake-proc-.

	Make obsolete aliases for (almost?) every symbol.

	Furthermore, many flymake-proc.el symbols are prefixed with
	"flymake-proc--", that is they were considered internal.

	Some customization variables, interactive functions, and other symbols

	Completely rewrite Flymake's subprocess output processing

	Instead of parsing and matching regexps line-by-line, insert
	subprocess output in a separate buffer and parse using
	`search-forward-regexp'.  This eventually enables multi-line error
	patterns and simplifies code all around.  Store per-check information
	in the subprocess using `process-get' and `process-put'.  Treat error
	messages, warnings, etc. more generically as "diagnostics".  Create
	these objects as soon as possible, reusing existing `flymake-ler'
	structure.  Fix some whitespace.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el (cl-lib): Require also when
	loading.
	(flymake--fix-line-numbers): Rename from
	flymake-fix-line-numbers.  Simplify.
	(flymake-report): Call flymake--fix-line-numbers.  Rearrange
	plain diagnostics list into alist format expected by
	flymake-highlight-err-lines.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el (flymake-process-filter): Insert
	process output and parse in dedicated output buffer.
	(flymake-proc--diagnostics-for-pattern): New helper function.
	(flymake-process-sentinel): Call flymake-post-syntax-check with
	collected diagnostics.  Kill output buffer.
	(flymake-post-syntax-check): Receive diagnostics as third argument.
	(flymake-parse-output-and-residual, flymake-new-err-info)
	(flymake-parse-residual, flymake-parse-err-lines)
	(flymake-split-output, flymake-proc-parse-line)
	(flymake-output-residual): Delete.
	(flymake-start-syntax-check-process): Use make-process.	 Setup
	dedicated an output buffer

2017-10-03  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	Split Flymake into flymake.el into flymake-proc.el (again!)

	After deciding that this work would continue on master only, which
	caused two commits named

	   Revert "Split flymake.el into flymake-proc.el and flymake-ui.el"

	and

	   Revert "Add flymake-backends defcustom"

	to be added to the emacs-26 branch, further discussion reversed that
	decision.

	   See:

	     https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-09/msg01020.html
	     https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-09/msg01030.html

	This means that those two commits MUST be merged to master AFTER ALL.

	flymke-proc.el contains the main syntax-checking backend, while
	flymake.el keeps mostly the UI part.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el: New file.  Require flymake.

	* lisp/progmodes/flymake.el: Require flymake-proc.el at the end.

	* lisp/time.el (display-time-world-list): Default to t,
	a special value that expands to zoneinfo-style-word-list
	if that works, and to legacy-style-word-list otherwise.

	In other words, re-coalesce the two files,
	lisp/progmodes/flymake-proc.el and lisp/progmodes/flymake-ui.el, back

	are kept in place in the new lisp/progmodes/flymake.el.

	Avoid some unnecessary copying in Fformat etc.

	This patch is just for performance; it should not affect behavior.
	On my platform, it made the microbenchmark (format "%S" load-path)

	Prefer HTTPS to FTP and HTTP in documentation

	Most of this change is to boilerplate commentary such as license URLs.
	This change was prompted by ftp://ftp.gnu.org's going-away party,
	planned for November.  Change these FTP URLs to https://ftp.gnu.org
	instead.  Make similar changes for URLs to other organizations moving
	away from FTP.  Also, change HTTP to HTTPS for URLs to gnu.org and
	fsf.org when this works, as this will further help defend against
	man-in-the-middle attacks (for this part I omitted the MS-DOS and
	MS-Windows sources and the test tarballs to keep the workload down).
	HTTPS is not fully working to lists.gnu.org so I left those URLs alone
	for now.

2017-09-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2017-09-12  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Implement and-let*

	This also includes changes to if-let and when-let.  The single tuple
	special case is ambiguous, and binding a symbol to nil is not as
	useful as binding it to its value outside the lexical scope of the
	binding.  (Bug#28254)
	* etc/NEWS: Mention.
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el (internal--listify):
	(internal--build-binding-value-form): Extend to account for
	solitary symbols and (EXPR) items in binding varlist.
	(if-let*, when-let*): Nix single tuple case and incumbent
	bind-symbol-to-nil behavior.
	(and-let*): New macro.
	(if-let, when-let): Mark obsolete.  Redefine in terms of if-let*, so
	they implicitly gain the new features without breaking existing code.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x-tests.el: Adjust tests for: lack of
	single-tuple special case, lack of binding solitary symbols to nil,
	and the introduction of uninterned symbols for (EXPR) bindings.  Add
	SRFI-2 test suite adapted to Elisp.

	* lisp/textmodes/enriched.el (enriched-translations):
	Re-enable FUNCTION and display translations that are safe.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-restore-<>-properties): After failing an
	attempted match from the start of a token (in particular, "<<"), move to the

	immediate clue of whether different byte code printouts are for the
	same or different byte code objects.
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-print.el (cl-print-object): Add object sxhash to

	Improve --enable-gcc-warnings for MinGW64

	This partially reverts my 2016-05-30 patch.  Apparently MinGW64

	Use text-property buttons in rcirc-markup-urls

	* lisp/net/rcirc.el (rcirc-markup-urls): Use `make-text-button'

	Do not split line before width of fill-prefix

	When auto-filling a paragraph, don't split a line before the width of the
	fill-prefix, creating a subsequent line that is as long or longer (Bug#20774).
	* lisp/simple.el (do-auto-fill): Only consider break-points that are later in

	tokens.  If a token starts with a quote, then it naturally is expected
	to end with a quote; escaping is not supported. This is enough to cope
	with the typical case of requiring the initial path to be quoted,
	common on Windows where it may contain spaces.
	* etc/NEWS: Document.
	* doc/emacs/misc.texi: Likewise.
	* doc/man/emacsclient.1: Tweak to remove the implication that only an
	editor can be specified (the manual already mentions a “command”).
	Fix a small error where “EDITOR” is referred to rather than
	“ALTERNATE_EDITOR”.
	* test/lib-src/emacsclient-tests.el: Add tests.

	Improve symlinks for Tramp

	* lisp/files.el (files--splice-dirname-file): Quote whole file.

	* lisp/net/tramp-sh.el (tramp-sh-handle-make-symbolic-link):
	Do not expand TARGET, it could be remote.
	(tramp-sh-handle-file-truename): Check for cyclic symlink also
	in case of readlink.  Quote result if it looks remote.
	(tramp-sh-handle-file-local-copy): Use `file-truename'.

	* test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el (tramp-test08-file-local-copy)
	(tramp-test09-insert-file-contents): Test also file missing.
	(tramp-test21-file-links): Extend test.

	Minor simplification for byte-compile-constant-push

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-constant): Move the meat

	(byte-compile-constant-push): ... to here.  No need to bind
	byte-compile--for-effect anymore.

2017-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Prefer file-name-quote to concat "/:"

	Suggested by Michael Albinus (Bug#28264#13).
	* lisp/files.el (files--splice-dirname-file): Use file-name-quote
	rather than attempting to do it by hand.

2017-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac: fix typo in previous change

2017-08-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Be more conservative in link time optimization doc

	While testing --enable-link-time-optimization with GCC 7.1.1
	I ran into a serious GCC code-generation bug which makes me
	think that --enable-link-time-optimization should be
	discouraged for typical installs (Bug#28213).  See:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1486455

2017-08-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Make garbage collection more conservative

	Check for a pointer anywhere within the object, as opposed to just
	the start of the object.  This is needed for gcc -Os -flto on
	x86-64 (Bug#28213).  This change means that the garbage collector
	is more conservative, and will incorrectly keep objects that it
	does not need to, but that is better than incorrectly discarding
	objects that should be kept.
	* src/alloc.c (ADVANCE, VINDEX): Now functions, not macros;
	this is easier to debug.
	(setup_on_free_list): Rename from SETUP_ON_FREE_LIST.
	Now a function with two args, not a macro with three.
	All callers changed.
	(live_string_holding, live_cons_holding, live_symbol_holding)
	(live_misc_holding, live_vector_holding, live_buffer_holding):
	New functions, which check for any object containing the addressed
	byte, not just for an object at the given address.
	(live_string_p, live_cons_p, live_symbol_p, live_misc_p)
	(live_vector_p, live_buffer_p):
	Redefine in terms of the new functions.
	(live_float_p): Refactor slightly to match the new functions.
	(mark_maybe_object, mark_maybe_pointer): Use the new functions.
	Don’t bother checking mark bits, as mark_object already does that,
	and omitting the checks here simplifies the code.  Although
	mark_maybe_object can continue to insist that tagged pointers
	still address the start of the object, mark_maybe_pointer now is
	more conservative and checks for pointers anywhere into an object.

2017-08-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve stack-top heuristic

	This is needed for gcc -Os -flto on x86-64; otherwise, GC misses part
	of the stack when scanning for heap roots, causing Emacs to crash
	later (Bug#28213).  The problem is that Emacs's hack for getting an
	address near the stack top does not work when link-time optimization
	moves stack variables around.
	* configure.ac (HAVE___BUILTIN_FRAME_ADDRESS): New macro.
	* lib-src/make-docfile.c (DEFUN_noinline): New constant.
	(write_globals, scan_c_stream): Support noinline.
	* src/alloc.c (NEAR_STACK_TOP): New macro.
	(SET_STACK_TOP_ADDRESS): Use it.
	(flush_stack_call_func, Fgarbage_collect): Now noinline.

2017-08-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Align stack bottom properly.

	This is needed for gcc -Os -flto on x86-64 (Bug#28213).
	* src/emacs.c (main): Align stack-bottom variable as a pointer,
	since mark_memory requires this.

2017-08-29  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Avoid spinning waiting for git-gui.exe on Windows

	* src/w32proc.c (waitpid): If GetExitCodeProcess returns

2017-08-29  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Use string-match to check for dotfiles in ido

	* lisp/ido.el (ido-make-file-list): Use string-match to check
	for dotfiles instead of substring, as when using tramp
	simplified syntax ido-temp-list may contain empty strings.

2017-08-28  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Font-lock FDO desktop files correctly

	Single and double quotes do not have a special meaning in
	desktop files.
	https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
	* etc/NEWS: Mention new mode.
	* lisp/files.el (auto-mode-alist): Split out an entry for handling

	test.

2017-08-27  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Disable completion while entering python multiline statements

	The "legacy" completion mechanism sends newlines to the running python
	process to get the list of completions, which confuses things if the
	user is in the middle of entering a multiline statement (Bug#28051).
	It's better to disable completion in this case.
	* lisp/progmodes/python.el (python-shell--block-prompt): New variable.
	(python-shell-prompt-set-calculated-regexps): Set it.
	(python-shell-completion-at-point): Return 'ignore' as the completion

	Fix over-protection of byte-compiled files

	Problem reported by Sven Joachim (Bug#28244).
	Also, fix similar problem for autoload files.

	(conf-toml-recognize-section): New function.

2017-08-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Do not munge contents of local symbolic links

	This lets Emacs deal with arbitrary local symlinks without
	mishandling their contents (Bug#28156).  For example,
	(progn (shell-command "ln -fs '~' 'x'") (rename-file "x" "/tmp/x"))
	now consistently creates a symbolic link from '/tmp/x' to '~'.
	Formerly, it did that only if the working directory was on the
	same filesystem as /tmp; otherwise, it expanded the '~' to
	the user's home directory.
	* lisp/dired.el (dired-get-filename): Use files--name-absolute-system-p
	instead of rolling our own code.
	* lisp/files.el (files--name-absolute-system-p): New function.
	(file-truename, file-chase-links): Use it to avoid mishandling
	symlink contents that begin with ~.
	(copy-directory, move-file-to-trash):
	Use concat rather than expand-file-name, to avoid mishandling
	symlink contents that begin with ~.
	* src/fileio.c (Fmake_symbolic_link): Do not expand leading "~" in the
	target unless interactive.  Strip leading "/:" if interactive.
	(emacs_readlinkat): Do not prepend "/:" to the link target if
	it starts with "/" and contains ":" before NUL.
	* test/src/fileio-tests.el (try-link): Rename from try-char,
	and accept a string instead of a char.  All uses changed.
	(fileio-tests--symlink-failure): Also test leading ~, and "/:",
	to test the new behavior.

2017-08-27  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove invalid regexp for shell builtins for wksh

	* lisp/progmodes/sh-script.el (sh-builtins): Shell built-ins have to

	defunct proprietary shell.

2017-08-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	(tramp-handle-make-symbolic-link):
	* lisp/net/tramp-sh.el (tramp-sh-handle-make-symbolic-link)
	(tramp-sh-handle-add-name-to-file):
	* lisp/net/tramp-smb.el (tramp-smb-handle-add-name-to-file)
	(tramp-smb-handle-make-symbolic-link): Adapt implementation to
	stronger semantics in Emacs.  (Bug#28156)

	* test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el (tramp-test21-file-links):
	Extend test.

2017-08-26  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Support multi-lingual detection of SEE ALSO man sections

	* lisp/man.el (Man-see-also-regexp): Add support for SEE ALSO
	section detection in several langages: French, German, Spanish,
	Portugese, Italian, Polish, Turkish, Japanese, Chinese.  (Bug#28142)

2017-08-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve expand-file-name doc

	* doc/lispref/files.texi (Relative File Names, Directory Names)
	(File Name Expansion):
	* doc/lispref/minibuf.texi (Reading File Names):
	Document expand-file-name behavior with ~ more clearly
	and accurately.
	* doc/misc/org.texi (Batch execution): Simplify example
	script so that it does not need expand-file-name and thus
	will not mishandle file names with leading ~.

2017-08-26  Jefferson Carpenter  <jeffersoncarpenter2@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	Support all perl variable declarators and prefixes (Bug#27613)

	* lisp/progmodes/perl-mode.el (perl-imenu-generic-expression)
	(perl-font-lock-keywords-2): Match declators 'anon', 'argument', 'has',
	'local', 'state', 'supersede', 'let', and 'temp'.

2017-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix file-attributes race on GNU hosts

	* doc/lispref/files.texi (File Attributes):
	Document file-attributes atomicity.
	* etc/NEWS: Document the fix.
	* src/dired.c (file_attributes): New args DIRNAME and FILENAME,
	for diagnostics.  All callers changed.  On platforms like
	GNU/Linux that support O_PATH, fix a race condition in
	file-attributes and similar functions, so that these functions do
	not return nonsense if a directory entry is replaced while getting
	its attributes.  On non-GNU platforms, do a better (though not
	perfect) job of detecting the race, and return nil if detected.

2017-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify expand_and_dir_to_file

	* src/fileio.c (expand_and_dir_to_file): Simplify by omitting 2nd
	argument, since in practice it always has the default value.  All
	callers changed.  Prefer C99 style decls in nearby code.

2017-08-25  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix file-name completion on network shares

	* src/w32.c (faccessat): Don't assume that F_OK is non-zero.
	(Bug#28207)

2017-08-25  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Fix a FIXME with an exegetical comment

	* lisp/progmodes/sh-script.el (sh-builtins): Explain why we have a
	regexp for wksh builtins.

2017-08-25  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Minor docstring language fix

	* lisp/progmodes/sh-script.el (sh-show-indent): Remove spurious “the”.

2017-08-25  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove old commented code from sh-script.el

	* lisp/progmodes/sh-script.el (sh-abbrevs): Remove commented function
	and variable, commented since 2001.

2017-08-25  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el: Don't let failure stop us

	(package-activate-1): Don't throw an error for missing deps.
	(package-unpack): Don't bother compiling if activation failed.
	(package-initialize): Report failures but keep activating other packages.

2017-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Prefer ‘double’ for FP temps in xterm.c

	* src/xterm.c (xm_scroll_callback, xaw_jump_callback)
	(x_set_toolkit_scroll_bar_thumb)
	(x_set_toolkit_horizontal_scroll_bar_thumb): Prefer ‘double’ to
	‘float’ for individual local floating-point temporaries.

2017-08-24  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Avoid using string-to-multibyte in ispell.el

	* lisp/textmodes/ispell.el (ispell-get-decoded-string): Use
	decode-coding-string instead. Note that decode-coding-string returns a
	string that satisfies multibyte-string-p even if its input is pure

	(skkdic-collect-okuri-nasi): Just set
	`skkdic-okuri-nasi-entries-count' at once at the end rather than

	skkdic-get-candidate-list, skkdic-collect-okuri-nasi)
	(skkdic-extract-conversion-data): Use `match-string-no-properties'

	* doc/emacs/files.texi (Copying and Naming):
	New section, split off from Misc File Ops and containing the
	operations that copy, name or rename files.  This fixes some
	confusion caused by the incorrect phrase "The same rule applies
	to all the remaining commands in this section" in the old manual.
	This change does not affect the confusion about directories (see
	Bug#27986 for ongoing discussion).

	Fix make-temp-file bug with ""/"."/".." prefix

	The bug with "." and ".." has been present for a while; I
	introduced the bug with "" earlier today in my patch for Bug#28023.
	* lisp/files.el (make-temp-file): Do not use expand-file-name if
	PREFIX is empty or "." or "..", as it does the wrong thing.
	Compute absolute-prefix here ...
	(files--make-magic-temp-file): ... instead of here ...
	* src/fileio.c (Fmake_temp_file_internal): ... or here.

	* lisp/files.el (make-temp-file): If the prefix is empty, append
	"/" to the absolute prefix so that the new files are children
	rather than siblings of temporary-file-directory.  This fixes a
	bug introduced in the previous change.
	* test/lisp/files-tests.el (files-test-make-temp-file-empty-prefix):
	New test, for the bug.

2017-08-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve make-temp-file performance on local files

	For the motivation behind this patch, please see Bug#28023 and:
	http://emacshorrors.com/posts/make-temp-name.html
	Although, given the recent changes to Tramp, the related security
	problem in make-temp-file is already fixed, make-temp-file still has
	several unnecessary system calls.  In the typical case on GNU/Linux,
	this patch replaces 8 syscalls (symlink, open, close, readlinkat, uname,
	getpid, unlink, umask) by 2 (open, close).
	* admin/merge-gnulib (GNULIB_MODULES): Add tempname, now
	that Emacs is using it directly.
	* configure.ac (AUTO_DEPEND): Remove AC_SYS_LONG_FILE_NAMES;
	no longer needed.
	* lib/gnulib.mk.in, m4/gnulib-comp.m4: Regenerate.

	Fix completion on directory names on MS-DOS/MS-Windows

	* src/msdos.c (faccessat):
	* src/w32.c (faccessat): Support relative file names, and add D_OK
	to 'mode' if the argument is a directory.  This unbreaks file-name
	completion when the completion result is a directory.

2017-08-11  Stephen Berman  <steve@rosalinde.fritz.box>

	Fix a minor todo-mode regression

	* lisp/calendar/todo-mode.el (todo-get-overlay): Wrap in
	save-excursion.  This fixes a regression introduced by the fix
	for bug#27609, whereby trying to raise the priority of the
	first item or lower the priority of the last item, which
	should be noops, moves point to the item's start.  Clarify
	comment.

	* test/lisp/calendar/todo-mode-tests.el
	(todo-test-raise-lower-priority): Add test cases for trying to
	raise first item and lower last item.
	(with-todo-test): Clear abbreviated-home-dir, since we change HOME.
	(todo-test-toggle-item-header02): Remove ":expected-result
	:failed" and tests of point after todo-next-item, since the
	effect when using Todo mode is not reproducible in the test
	environment.  Add commentary about this.

2017-08-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve performance for rename-file etc.

	Although this does not fix Bug#27986, it is a step forward.
	I plan to propose a more-significant patch later.
	* lisp/files.el (directory-name-p): Move from here ...
	* src/fileio.c (Fdirectory_name_p): ... to here.
	(directory_like, cp_like_target): New static functions.
	(Fcopy_file, Frename_file, Fadd_name_to_file)
	(Fmake_symbolic_link):
	Use them, to avoid directory-testing syscalls on file names that
	must be directories if they exist.  Omit unnecessary
	initializations and CHECK_STRING calls.
	(Frename_file): Don't call file_name_case_insensitive_p
	twice on the same file.  Compare both file names expanded, instead
	of the old name expanded and the new one unexpanded.

2017-08-11  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	local variables from the right buffer later.
	* test/lisp/progmodes/etags-tests.el (etags-visit-tags-table-buffer):
	New test.
	* test/lisp/progmodes/etags-tests.el (etags-tests--test-dir): New
	constant.
	(etags-bug-158, etags-bug-23164): Use it so that when running the test
	interactively, setting EMACS_TEST_DIRECTORY is not needed.

	(emacs_abort): If w32-disable-abort-dialog is non-nil, abort right
	away, without displaying the Abort dialog, which waits for the user.

	* lisp/replace.el (replace--push-stack):
	New macro extracted from `perform-replace'.
	(perform-replace): Use it.

2017-08-08  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't define gv expanders in compiler's runtime (Bug#27016)

	This prevents definitions being compiled from leaking into the current
	Emacs doing the compilation.
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/gv.el (gv-define-expander): Use function-put instead
	of `put' with `eval-and-compile'.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/gv-tests.el: New tests.

2017-08-08  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Let the cl-typep effects of defclass work during compilation (Bug#27718)

	it to nil.
	(byte-compile-define-symbol-prop): New function, handles compilation
	of top-level `define-symbol-prop' and `function-put' calls by putting

	Consider circular lists to be non-equal instead of signaling error.

2017-08-08  Alexander Gramiak  <agrambot@gmail.com>

	Catch argument and macroexpansion errors in ert

	This kludge catches errors caused by evaluating arguments in ert's
	should, should-not, and should-error macros; it also catches

	This reverts commit 28f1fe97daa13e13714e6c43c9a6fbb0c0e99a26.

2017-08-07  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Add support for arguments in ALTERNATE_EDITOR to emacsclient

	* lib-src/emacsclient.c (fail): Parse ALTERNATE_EDITOR, or
	corresponding command-line argument, into space-separated tokens.
	* etc/NEWS: Document.
	* test/lib-src/emacsclient-tests.el: Add a test.

2017-08-07  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Add Enchant support to ispell.el (Bug#17742)

	* lisp/textmodes/ispell.el (ispell-program-name): Add “enchant”.
	(ispell-really-enchant): Add variable.
	(ispell-check-version): If using Enchant, check it’s new enough (at
	least 1.6.1).  (Like the ispell check, this is absolute: cannot work
	without.)
	(ispell-enchant-dictionary-alist): Add variable.
	(ispell-find-enchant-dictionaries): Add function, based on
	ispell-find-aspell-dictionaries.
	(ispell-set-spellchecker-params): Allow dictionary auto-detection for
	Enchant, and call ispell-find-enchant-dictionaries to find them.  Use
	old ispell name to locale mapping code for Enchant too.
	(ispell-send-replacement): Make it work with Enchant.

2017-08-07  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Allow async command output buffer to be shown only on output

	* lisp/simple.el (async-shell-command-display-buffer): Add
	defcustom.
	(shell-command): Use the new defcustom to determine whether to show
	the buffer immediately, or add a process filter that shows it only
	when there is some output.
	* etc/NEWS: Document the new variable.
	* doc/emacs/misc.texi: Likewise.

	Thanks to Juri Linkov and Eli Zaretskii for advice and guidance.

2017-08-07  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix infinite recursion under prettify-symbols-mode and linum-mode

	* src/xdisp.c (get_overlay_strings_1)
	(handle_single_display_spec, push_prefix_prop): Invalidate the
	composition information before starting to iterate on a string.
	Otherwise we might think in set_iterator_to_next that we are
	delivering characters from a composition, and do all kinds of
	nonsensical things, like over-step the string end.  (Bug#27761)

2017-08-07  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Fix a couple more make-temp-file races

	* lisp/files.el (basic-save-buffer-2, move-file-to-trash):
	Use make-temp-name, not make-temp-file with retry.
	(basic-save-buffer-2): Use condition-case, instead of
	unwind-protect with a success flag.

2017-08-07  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Merge null and without-null regexp alists (Bug#27840, Bug#27873)

	(grep-with-null-regexp-alist, grep-fallback-regexp-alist): Remove.
	(grep-regexp-alist): Recombine their contents here.
	(grep-mode):
	* lisp/cedet/semantic/symref/grep.el
	(semantic-symref-parse-tool-output-one-line):
	* lisp/progmodes/xref.el (xref-collect-matches): Use the variable

	Fix some crashes on self-modifying Elisp code

	Prompted by a problem report by Alex in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-08/msg00143.html
	* src/eval.c (For, Fprogn, Fsetq, FletX, eval_sub):
	Compute XCDR (x) near XCAR (x); although this doesn't fix any bugs,
	it is likely to run a bit faster with typical hardware caches.
	(Fif): Use Fcdr instead of XCDR, to avoid crashing on
	self-modifying S-expressions.
	(Fsetq, Flet, eval_sub): Count the number of arguments as we go
	instead of trusting an Flength prepass, to avoid problems when the
	code is self-modifying.
	(Fquote, Ffunction, Fdefvar, Fdefconst): Prefer !NILP to CONSP
	where either will do.  This is mostly to document the fact that
	the value must be a proper list.  It's also a tiny bit faster on
	typical machines nowadays.
	(Fdefconst, FletX): Prefer XCAR+XCDR to Fcar+Fcdr when either will do.
	(eval_sub): Check that the args are a list as opposed to some
	other object that has a length. This prevents e.g. (if . "string")
	from making Emacs dump core in some cases.
	* test/src/eval-tests.el (eval-tests--if-dot-string)
	(eval-tests--let-with-circular-defs, eval-tests--mutating-cond):
	New tests.

2017-08-06  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

2017-08-06  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	dired-delete-file: Do not TAB complete the user answer

	This action might delete directories containing valuable information.
	Before previous commit, we prompted users with `yes-or-no-p'
	which doesn't TAB complete the user answer.  Let's play safe and
	keep requiring full answers.
	* emacs-master/lisp/dired.el (dired-delete-file): Use `read-string'
	instead of `completing-read' to read the user answers.

2017-08-06  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	dired-do-delete: Allow to delete dirs recursively without prompts

	* lisp/dired.el (dired-delete-file): Accept 2 additional answers:
	'all', to delete all directories recursively and no prompt anymore.
	'quit', to cancel directory deletions (Bug#27940).
	Show help message when user inputs 'help'.
	(dired-do-flagged-delete): Bind locally dired-recursive-deletes
	so that we can overwrite its global value.
	Wrapp the loop within a catch '--delete-cancel to catch when
	the user abort the directtry deletion.
	* doc/emacs/dired.texi (Dired Deletion): Update manual.
	* etc/NEWS (Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 26.1):
	Announce this change.

2017-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a couple of make-temp-file races

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/autoload.el (autoload--save-buffer):
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-file):
	Use make-temp-file, not make-temp-name, to avoid an unlikely race
	that could lose data.  Remove the deletion hook as quickly as
	possible after the file is renamed; though a race still remains
	here, it is smaller than before.

2017-08-06  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Dired w/ eshell-ls: Handle shell wildcards in file name

	* lisp/eshell/em-ls.el (eshell-ls--insert-directory):

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27844): Add test.

2017-08-06  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	dired-revert: save line numbers instead of positions

	Positions might change if the length of one dired header line
	changes; this happen, for instance, if we add new files.
	Instead, line numbers are invariant under shrinks/enlargements
	of the file header.
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-07/msg01092.html
	* lisp/dired.el (dired-save-positions): Save the line numbers at point.
	(dired-restore-positions): Use forward-line to restore the original
	position (Bug#27968).
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27968): Add test.

2017-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port recent rename changes to Ubuntu 14.04

	* src/sysdep.c (renameat_noreplace) [!RENAME_NOREPLACE]:
	Don’t use syscall.  Problem reported by Tino Calancha (Bug#27946#10).

2017-08-05  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	insert-directory-wildcard-in-dir-p: Tweak regexp

	This function must return non-nil for a wildcard like '/*/*.txt'.
	* lisp/files.el (insert-directory-wildcard-in-dir-p): Adjust regexp.
	* test/lisp/files-tests.el (files-tests--insert-directory-wildcard-in-dir-p):
	Add test.

2017-08-04  Toby S. Cubitt  <tsc25@cantab.net>

	Implement iterator generator for avl-trees.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/avl-tree.el (avl-tree-iter): New iter-defun.

2017-08-04  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	ls-lisp: Drop eshell dependencies

	Use 'file-expand-wildcards' instead of 'eshell-extended-glob' to
	expand the wildcards.
	Suggested by Fabrice Popineau in:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-08/msg00108.html
	* lisp/ls-lisp.el (ls-lisp--dired): Use file-expand-wildcards.

2017-08-04  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Fix dired-test-bug27631 on MS-Windows

	Skip the test if Dired use 'ls' emulation with lisp.  The same
	bug is tested in their respective test suites: ls-lisp-tests.el
	and em-ls-tests.el.
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27631): Skip test if 'ls-lisp'
	or 'eshell' features are enabled.

2017-08-04  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix dired-test-bug25609 on MS-Windows

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug25609): On MS-Windows,
	pass temporary files through file-truename, to avoid bogus
	failures due to file-name comparison as strings.

2017-08-04  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Fix 2 tests that fail in MS-Windows

	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-08/msg00018.html
	* test/lisp/vc/ediff-ptch-tests.el (ediff-ptch-test-bug26084):
	Add comments to explain the test logic.
	Pass '--binary' option to 'patch' program in windows environments.
	Check explicitely that a backup is created before compare file contents.

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug25609):
	Declare variable 'dired-dwim-target' right before the test.
	Add comments to explain the test logic.
	Ensure, before test the bug condition, that we are displaying the
	2 dired buffers created in this test, and no other dired buffer
	is shown.

2017-08-04  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/shell.el (explicit-shell-file-name): Mention shell-file-name

	* lisp/files.el (insert-directory): Don't hardcode "-c".
	* lisp/term.el (term, ansi-term): Use shell-file-name.

2017-08-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix version numbers for some GnuTLS features

	Problem reported by Glenn Morris (Bug#27708#58).
	* src/gnutls.c (HAVE_GNUTLS_X509_SYSTEM_TRUST):
	New macro.  Use it instead of low-level version number checks.
	(HAVE_GNUTLS_AEAD): Move here from gnutls.h, and rename from
	HAVE_GNUTLS3_AEAD.  All uses changed.  Indent preprocessor lines.
	* src/gnutls.h (HAVE_GNUTLS3_CIPHER, HAVE_GNUTLS3_DIGEST)
	(HAVE_GNUTLS3_HMAC): Remove, since these were available
	before GnuTLS 3.0.0 and the code checks them only if HAVE_GNUTLS3
	is defined.  Remove all uses; this simplifies the code a bit.

2017-08-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port recent rename changes to RHEL 7 + NFS

	Problem reported by Ted Zlatanov in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-08/msg00082.html
	* src/fileio.c (Frename_file): On RHEL 7 + NFS, renameat2 can fail
	with errno == EINVAL when it is not supported.  So treat that case
	like errno == ENOSYS.  Also, when ok_if_already_exists is neither
	nil nor an integer, just call plain rename; this avoids an extra
	syscall to renameat2 when the latter fails with errno == EINVAL or
	ENOSYS or ENOENT.

2017-08-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port GnuTLS usage to Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS

	* src/gnutls.h (HAVE_GNUTLS3_AEAD): Define only if GnuTLS 3.5.1 or
	later, as opposed to the old 3.4.0 or later.

2017-08-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify configuration of HAVE_GNUTLS3 etc.

	There's only one GnuTLS, so configuring these symbols at
	'configure' time is overkill.  Simplify things by moving their
	configuration to src/gnutls.h (Bug#27708).
	* configure.ac (HAVE_GNUTLS3, HAVE_GNUTLS3_HMAC, HAVE_GNUTLS3_AEAD)
	(HAVE_GNUTLS3_CIPHER, HAVE_GNUTLS3_DIGEST): Move these definitions
	from here ...
	* src/gnutls.h: ... to here, and simplify.

2017-08-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Default to --with-mailutils if it is installed

	* configure.ac (with_mailutils): Default to 'yes' if GNU Mailutils
	is installed.  See:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-08/msg00054.html

2017-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Clarify when autogen.sh should run only autoconf

	* Makefile.in (configure, bootstrap): Run ‘./autogen.sh autoconf’,
	not plain ‘./autogen.sh’, to make it clear that only
	autoconf-related tools should be run here.

2017-08-02  Toon Claes  <toon@iotcl.com>

	.gitlab-ci.yml: Use stretch Debian image instead of unstable

2017-08-02  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Add debugging messages to a Dired test

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27243-01): Log
	positions saved and restored by dired-revert to try and find
	out why the test fails on Hydra.

2017-08-02  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	ls-lisp: Autoload call instead of cookie

	* lisp/ls-lisp.el (eshell-extended-glob): autoload call instead of cookie.

2017-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	When renaming a file, ask only if EEXIST or ENOSYS

	* src/fileio.c (Frename_file): Avoid calling Ffile_directory_p
	more than once on FILE.  Use renameat_noreplace, so that we can
	ask the user (and unlink and retry) only if this fails with errno
	== EEXIST or ENOSYS.  This avoids the need to ask the user for
	permission to do an operation that will fail anyway.  Simplify
	computation of ok_if_already_exists for subsidiary functions.
	* src/filelock.c (rename_lock_file): Prefer renameat_noreplace
	if it works, as this avoids the need to link and unlink.
	* src/lisp.h (renameat_noreplace): New decl.
	* src/sysdep.c [HAVE_LINUX_FS_H]: Include linux/fs.h and sys/syscall.h.
	(renameat_noreplace): New function.

2017-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	When creating a link, ask only if EEXIST

	* src/fileio.c (Fadd_name_to_file, Fmake_symbolic_link):
	Ask the user (and unlink and retry) only if link creation fails
	with errno == EEXIST.  This avoids the need to ask the user for
	permission to do an operation that will fail anyway.

2017-08-02  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	dired-align-file: Inherit text properties in inserted spaces

	* lisp/dired.el (dired-align-file): Inherit text
	properties in inserted spaces (Bug#27899).
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27899): Add test.

2017-08-02  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Don't assume /bin/sh as the 'sh' location in the local host

	* lisp/dired.el (dired-insert-directory): Use executable-find in
	a local host.

2017-08-02  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Move dired tests using ls emulation to different files

	Suggested in:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-08/msg00018.html
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27693)
	(dired-test-bug27762, dired-test-bug27817)
	(dired-test-bug27631, dired-test-bug27843): Delete those
	parts requiring either ls-lisp or eshell-ls.

	* test/lisp/ls-lisp-tests.el (ls-lisp-test-bug27762)
	(ls-lisp-test-bug27631, ls-lisp-test-bug27693):
	Add all dired tests using ls-lisp here.

	* test/lisp/eshell/em-ls-tests.el (em-ls-test-bug27631)
	(em-ls-test-bug27817, em-ls-test-bug27843): New test file.  Add
	all dired tests using eshell-ls here.

2017-08-02  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	* test/lisp/ls-lisp-tests.el: Rename it from ls-lisp.el

2017-08-02  Katsumi Yamaoka  <yamaoka@jpl.org>

	* lisp/gnus/mm-uu.el (mm-uu-org-src-code-block-extract):
	Say the handle is already decoded.
	cf. <yw.87lgnh5cfv.fsf@alex.chromebook> in the info-gnus-english list.

2017-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don’t worry about unlink if errno == ENOENT

	* src/fileio.c (Fdelete_file):
	* src/keyboard.c (Fopen_dribble_file): Do not report failure to
	remove a file if unlink fails with errno == ENOENT.  This can
	happen even if Emacs is the only program removing the file, in
	case an NFS cache overflows.  The file does not exist if errno ==
	ENOENT, so it is OK to proceed.

2017-08-01  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Fix misalignment in Dired when dired-directory is a cons

	* lisp/dired.el (dired--need-align-p, dired--align-all-files):
	New defuns.
	(dired-internal-noselect): Call dired--align-all-files when
	dired-directory is a cons (Bug#27762).
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27762): Test should pass.

2017-08-01  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix some dired-tests.el on MS-Windows

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27243-01)
	(dired-test-bug27243-02): On MS-Windows, pass test-dir through
	file-truename, to avoid bogus failures due to file-name comparison
	as strings.

2017-08-01  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Insert subdir content if dir-or-list is a string w/o wildcards

	* lisp/eshell/em-ls.el (eshell-ls--insert-directory):
	Append '("-d") into 'eshell-ls-dired-initial-args'
	if 'dired-directory' is a cons or there are wildcars (Bug#27843).
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27843): Add test.

2017-08-01  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Update todo-mode defcustoms in a less hideous way

	* lisp/calendar/todo-mode.el (todo-reevaluate-filelist-defcustoms)
	(todo-reevaluate-default-file-defcustom)
	(todo-reevaluate-category-completions-files-defcustom)
	(todo-reevaluate-filter-files-defcustom): Delete these functions.
	(todo-update-filelist-defcustoms): New function.  This replaces
	todo-reevaluate-filelist-defcustoms, using the 'custom-type'
	property instead of re-evaluating the defcustoms.
	(todo-add-file, todo-rename-file, todo-delete-file)
	(todo-delete-category, todo-move-category)
	(todo-convert-legacy-files, todo-check-file): Replace call of
	todo-reevaluate-filelist-defcustoms by
	todo-update-filelist-defcustoms.
	(todo-show, todo-category-completions): Replace call of
	todo-reevaluate-* function by use of 'custom-type' property.

2017-08-01  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Add more should form calls in a failing dired test

	Some dired tests fail intermittently in hydra.  Add few
	more should form calls for debugging.
	See:

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27243-01): Add few more should
	forms for debugging.

2017-08-01  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Follow SAUNA recommendations for display-line-numbers-type

	* lisp/display-line-numbers.el (display-line-numbers-type): Do not autoload.

	* lisp/menu-bar.el (display-line-numbers-type): Declare.

2017-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Avoid most stat calls when completing file names

	* admin/merge-gnulib (GNULIB_MODULES): Add d-type.
	* lib/gnulib.mk.in, m4/gnulib-comp.m4: Regenerate.
	* m4/d-type.m4: New file, copied from gnulib.
	* src/dired.c (DT_UNKNOWN, DT_DIR, DT_LINK)
	[!HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE]: New constants.
	(dirent_type): New function.
	(file_name_completion): Use it, to avoid unnecessary calls to
	stat-like functions on GNU/Linux and other platforms with d_type.
	(file_name_completion_stat): Just follow the link; there is no
	need to try first with AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW since the directory
	entry was already checked to exist.

2017-07-31  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	dired-tests: Unload tested features after test them

	Some tests are for Dired with ls-lisp or eshell-ls.
	Requiring these features add an advice on `dired' and
	might affect other tests.
	Do not require these features at the top of the file; require
	then inside the tests and unload then at the end.
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27693)
	(dired-test-bug7131, dired-test-bug27817, dired-test-bug27631):
	require ls-lisp and/or eshell-ls inside the test; unload the
	features at the end.

2017-07-31  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Small adaptions for directory wildcards

	* lisp/dired.el (dired-insert-directory): Remove "--dired"
	when there are wildcards, and the directory is remote.

	* test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el (tramp--test-make-temp-name):
	Adapt docstring.
	(tramp-test17-dired-with-wildcards): Skip for all methods but

	* lib/tempname.c: Copy from gnulib.

2017-07-30  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	ls-lisp: Do not require em-glob at top of the file

	Require em-glob inside 'ls-lisp--dired'.  This is necessary to
	not break the Emacs build.
	See following thread for details:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-07/msg01083.html
	* lisp/ls-lisp.el (dired-goto-next-file)

	distinguish CSS properties from variables.

2017-07-30  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Dired: Handle posix wildcards in directory part

	Allow Dired to handle calls like
	\(dired \"~/foo/*/*.el\"), that is, with wildcards within
	the directory part of the file argument (Bug#27631).
	* lisp/files.el (insert-directory-wildcard-in-dir-p): New predicate.
	(insert-directory-clean): New defun extracted from insert-directory.
	(insert-directory)
	* lisp/dired.el (dired-internal-noselect)
	(dired-insert-directory): Use the new predicate; when it's true,
	handle the directory wildcards with a shell call.
	* lisp/eshell/em-ls.el (eshell-ls-use-in-dired): Add/remove both advices.
	(eshell-ls-unload-hook): New defun.  Use it in
	eshell-ls-unload-hook instead of an anonymous function.
	(eshell-ls--dired)
	* lisp/ls-lisp.el (ls-lisp--dired):
	Advice dired to handle wildcards in the directory part with both
	eshell-ls and ls-lisp.
	* etc/NEWS: Announce it.
	* doc/emacs/dired.texi (Dired Enter): Update manual.
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27631): Add test.

2017-07-29  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	* lisp/find-lisp.el: Enable lexical binding

	* lisp/kmacro.el: Use lexical binding.

2017-07-29  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Use lexical-binding in dired-aux.el

2017-07-29  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	artist.el: Avoid error with keyboard command invocation

	* lisp/textmodes/artist.el (artist-mouse-choose-operation):
	Call x-popup-menu with t instead of last-nonmenu-event as the
	value of the position argument; this allows invoking the
	command from the keyboard without raising an error (bug#27819).

2017-07-29  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Preserve point under 'dired-auto-revert-buffer' (third case)

	* lisp/files.el (find-file): Use pop-to-buffer-same-window
	instead of switch-to-buffer.  This preserves Dired window
	point when dired-auto-revert-buffer is non-nil.  (Bug#27243)

	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug27243-01)
	(dired-test-bug27243-02, dired-test-bug27243-03): New tests.
	The first two replace a previous test that combined them; that
	test intermittently fails in the Hydra build system, so maybe
	separating the two cases will help locate the point of
	failure.  The third test involves find-file but is here
	because it, like the others, is testing the effect of
	dired-auto-revert-buffer.

2017-07-29  Allen Li  <vianchielfaura@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	Do not unset user key remaps in dired-x

	Do not worry about paxctl on newer NetBSD

	Problem reported privately by Thomas Klausner.
	* configure.ac (emacs_uname_r): New var.  Use it to avoid paxctl

	coalescing duplicate actions.  There is no need to invoke
	SAFE_FREE before calling ‘error’.

	GnuTLS integer-overflow and style fixes

	This tweaks the recently-added GnuTLS improvements so that

	Emacs style a bit better.
	* configure.ac (HAVE_GNUTLS3_HMAC, HAVE_GNUTLS3_AEAD)

	CONSP rather than !NILP when testing for conses.  Use CAR_SAFE
	instead of rolling our own code.  Prefer signed types to unsigned
	when either will do.  Report problems for lengths out of range,
	instead of silently mishandling them.
	* src/gnutls.c (emacs_gnutls_strerror): New function, to simplify
	callers.  All callers of gnutls_sterror changed.
	(Fgnutls_boot): Check for integers out of range rather than

	calculations.

2017-07-13  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	C++ Mode.  Fix anomaly occurring when a ">" is deleted then reinserted.

	This fontification anomaly happened because after deleting the ">",
	c-forward-<>-arglist parses the preceding identifier as a putative type but
	stores it in c-found-types before it becomes clear it is not an unambiguous
	type.  c-forward-<>-arglist fails, leaving the spurious type id in
	c-found-types.  Fix this by "binding" c-found-types "to itself" in
	c-forward-<>-arglist, and restoring the original value when that function call
	fails.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-copy-found-types): New function.
	(c-forward-<>-arglist): Record the original value of c-found-types at the
	beginning of the function, and restore it at the end on failure.

	(ses-rename-cell): Set new cell name symbol to cell value --- do not
	rely on recalculating.  Push cells with updated data --- cell name,
	cell reference list, or cell formula --- to deferred write list.

	* test/lisp/ses-tests.el: New file, with 7 tests for SES.

	Avoid test failures due to backtraces.

2017-07-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix core dump in substitute-object-in-subtree

	Without this fix, (substitute-object-in-subtree #0=(#0# 'a) 'a)
	would dump core, since the C code would recurse indefinitely through
	the infinite structure.  This patch adds an argument to the function,
	and renames it to lread--substitute-object-in-subtree as the function
	is not general-purpose and should not be relied on by outside code.
	See Bug#23660.
	* src/intervals.c (traverse_intervals_noorder): ARG is now void *,
	not Lisp_Object, so that callers need not cons unnecessarily.
	All callers changed.  Also, remove related #if-0 code that was
	“temporary” in the early 1990s and has not been compilable for
	some time.
	* src/lread.c (struct subst): New type, for substitution closure data.
	(seen_list): Remove this static var, as this info is now part of
	struct subst.  All uses removed.
	(Flread__substitute_object_in_subtree): Rename from
	Fsubstitute_object_in_subtree, and give it a 3rd arg so that it
	doesn’t dump core when called from the top level with an
	already-cyclic structure.  All callers changed.
	(SUBSTITUTE): Remove.  All callers expanded and then simplified.
	(substitute_object_recurse): Take a single argument SUBST rather
	than a pair OBJECT and PLACEHOLDER, so that its address can be
	passed around as part of a closure; this avoids the need for an
	AUTO_CONS call.  All callers changed.  If the COMPLETED component
	is t, treat every subobject as potentially circular.
	(substitute_in_interval): Take a struct subst * rather than a
	Lisp_Object, for the closure data.  All callers changed.
	* test/src/lread-tests.el (lread-lread--substitute-object-in-subtree):
	New test, to check that the core dump does not reoccur.

2017-07-10  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Minor simplification of module_free_global_ref

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_free_global_ref): Remove unused variable
	'hashcode'.  Inline variable 'value' that's only used once.

2017-07-10  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Re-add a useful assertion

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_free_global_ref): Re-add assertion that
	the reference count is zero.  This assertion was removed in commit
	8afaa1321f8088bfb877fe4b6676e8517adb0bb7, but it's not included in the
	test performed by XFASTINT before, because the previous reference
	count could have been zero already in the case of a buggy
	implementation.  This assertion might have detected Bug#27587.

2017-07-10  Valentin Gatien-Baron  <vgatien-baron@janestreet.com>  (tiny change)

	Fix bug in module_free_global_ref (Bug#27587)

	Further improve electric quote support for Markdown (Bug#24709)

	Markdown sets both 'comment-start' and 'comment-use-syntax' to non-nil
	values.  Therefore 'electric-quote-mode' recognized it as a
	programming mode.  Fix this by first checking whether the current
	major mode is derived from 'text-mode'.

	* lisp/electric.el (electric-quote-post-self-insert-function): Treat
	'text-mode' as stronger signal than comment syntax.

	* test/lisp/electric-tests.el (electric-quote-markdown-in-text)
	(electric-quote-markdown-in-code): Adapt unit tests.

2017-07-09  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Optimize UCS normalization tests

	Brings the the time for `ucs-normalize-part1' from 200s down to 130s.
	* test/lisp/international/ucs-normalize-tests.el
	(ucs-normalize-tests--parse-column): Use character instead of string
	of length 1 for terminator.  Convert return value into string since
	all callers need that form anyway.
	(ucs-normalize-tests--normalization-equal-p): Rename from
	ucs-normalize-tests--normalize.  Use dedicated buffer instead of
	messing with narrowing.  Take string to compare against and insert it
	into buffer so that compare-buffer-substrings can be used instead of
	allocating a new string from buffer contents.
	(ucs-normalize-tests--normalization-chareq-p): New macro, specialized
	for comparing single character.
	(ucs-normalize-tests--rule1-holds-p)
	(ucs-normalize-tests--rule2-holds-p): Turn into defsubst.
	(ucs-normalize-tests--rule1-failing-for-partX): Use `eq' instead of

	* test/lisp/international/ucs-normalize-tests.el: Remove incorrect
	commentary describing a manual procedure for producing the updated

	new function which prints the updated values.
	(ucs-normalize-tests--rule1-holds-p): Renamed from
	ucs-normalize-tests--invariants-hold-p.
	(ucs-normalize-tests--rule2-holds-p): Renamed from

	(ucs-normalize-tests--rule1-failing-for-partX): Renamed from

	* lisp/cus-start.el (standard): Spelling fix.

2017-07-08  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Module assertions: check for garbage collections

	It's technically possible to write a user pointer finalizer that calls
	into Emacs module functions.  This would be disastrous because it
	would allow arbitrary Lisp code to run during garbage collection.
	Therefore extend the module assertions to check for this case.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_assert_thread): Also check whether a
	garbage collection is in progress.

	* test/data/emacs-module/mod-test.c (invalid_finalizer)

	(syms_of_indent): Defsubr it.
	* src/indent.c (Fvertical_motion): Help C-n/C-p estimate correctly

	Introduce a new user option 'electric-quote-context-sensitive'.  If
	non-nil, have ' insert an opening quote if sensible.

	Remove FIXME comments about sentinel values

	These FIXMEs can't be addressed because they would require breaking
	changes to the module API.  Furthermore, other module functions don't
	return sentinel values as well, so users generally have to call
	non_local_exit_check anyway.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_set_user_ptr)
	(module_set_user_finalizer, module_vec_set, module_vec_size): Remove
	FIXME comments.

2017-07-02  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Make C++ digit separators work.  Amend the handling of single quotes generally

	Single quotes, even in strings and comments, are now marked with the
	"punctuation" syntax-table property, except where they are validly bounding a

	where they are valid.  This is done in C, C++, ObjC, and Java Modes.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-defs.el (c-clear-char-property-with-value-on-char-function)

	Improve ert backtrace recording

	Change ert to use the new `backtrace-frames' function instead of
	collecting frames one by one with `backtrace-frame'.  Additionally,
	collect frames starting from `signal' instead the somewhat arbitrary
	"6 from the bottom".  Skipping 6 frames would skip the expression that
	actually caused the signal that triggered the debugger.  Possibly 6
	was chosen because in the case of a failed test, the triggering frame
	is an `ert-fail' call, which is not so interesting.  But in case of a
	test throwing an error, this drops the `error' call which is too much.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/debug.el (debugger-make-xrefs): Remove.
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/ert.el (ert--make-xrefs-region): Bring in relevant
	code from `debugger-make-xrefs'.

	`debugger-insert-backtrace'.
	(ert--run-test-debugger): Record the backtrace frames starting from
	the instigating `signal' call.
	(ert-run-tests-batch): Pass nil for `ert--print-backtrace's new
	DO-XREFS parameter.
	(ert-results-pop-to-backtrace-for-test-at-point): Pass t as DO-XREFS
	to `ert--print-backtrace' and remove call to `debugger-make-xrefs'.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/ert-tests.el (ert-test-record-backtrace): Check
	the backtrace list instead of comparing its string representation.
	Expect `signal' to be the first frame.

2017-06-30  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Operate on frame list instead of printed backtrace

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/debug.el (debugger-insert-backtrace): New function,
	prints the given backtrace frames.
	(debugger-setup-buffer): Use it instead of editing the backtrace
	buffer text.

2017-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Omit null-pointer test in intervals.h FRAME

	* src/intervals.h (ROOT_INTERVAL_P, ONLY_INTERVAL_P)
	(INTERVAL_LAST_POS): Omit unnecessary parens.
	(LENGTH): Omit test for null pointer.  The argument is never null.
	The unnecessary test causes GCC 7.1.0 to assume that the argument
	might be null, and therefore to issue false alarms when the
	argument is dereferenced in other expressions.

2017-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Parenthesize frame.h macro definitions

	* src/frame.h (FRAME_TOOL_BAR_POSITION)

	to allow arbitrary expression arguments.

2017-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port recent frame changes to GCC 7

	* src/frame.c (keep_ratio): New arg P.  Caller changed.  Since it
	is non-null, it avoids a GCC 7 warning that FRAME_PARENT_FRAME
	might return null.  This also avoids a run-time test.

2017-06-25  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Minor aesthetic fix of last change.

	producing space glyphs instead of a line number to include the
	case of display strings and overlays.

2017-06-25  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Make CC Mode load cl-lib rather than cl in Emacs 26.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-cmds.el (c-declaration-limits): Remove unused local
	variable.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-defs.el (c--mapcan-status): Remove.

2017-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Adjust lm-verify to accept current notices

	Problem reported by Mike Kupfer in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-06/msg00512.html
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/lisp-mnt.el (lm-crack-copyright):
	Do not require later lines in a copyright notice to have more
	indentation than earlier lines.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Minor change in NEWS.

	Improve documentation in NEWS.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Move additional hscrolling code into a suitable 'if'

	* src/xdisp.c (hscroll_window_tree): Make additional calculations
	regarding glyphs produced for line numbers conditional on
	line-number display.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Partial fix of hscroll of truncated lines with line numbers

	* src/xdisp.c (x_produce_glyphs, hscroll_window_tree): Adjust
	hscroll calculations to line-number display.
	* src/term.c (produce_glyphs): Adjust tab stop to window's
	hscroll.  These two changes fix horizontal scrolling when line
	numbers are displayed.  But there's still a bug: the horizontal
	shift of lines that begin with a TAB is different from the rest.
	* src/xdisp.c (move_it_in_display_line_to): Call
	should_produce_line_number to determine whether a line number
	should be produced for this screen line.

2017-06-24  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't change byte-compile-delete-errors at runtime (Bug#27340)

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/eieio-core.el: Confine `cl-declaim' calls to compile
	time.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Allow Lisp program to disable line-number display for specific lines

	* etc/NEWS: Update the documentation.

	* src/xdisp.c (syms_of_xdisp) <display-line-numbers-disable>: New
	symbol.
	(should_produce_line_number): New function.
	(display_line): Use should_produce_line_number to determine
	whether a line number should be produced for each glyph row.

2017-06-24  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/net/html2text.el: Move to obsolete/.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Support a separate face for displaying the current line's number

	* lisp/faces.el (line-number-current-line): New face.

	* src/xdisp.c (syms_of_xdisp) <line-number-current-line>: New
	symbol.
	(try_window_id, try_cursor_movement): Disable these optimizations
	when the line-number-current-line face is different from
	line-number face.
	(maybe_produce_line_number): Display the current line in the
	line-number-current-line face, if it's different from line-number.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Change display of current line in relative mode

	* src/xdisp.c (maybe_produce_line_number): In relative mode
	display the current line number as its absolute value, not as zero.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Rename display-line-width

	* etc/NEWS:
	* src/xdisp.c (syms_of_xdisp, maybe_produce_line_number):
	* lisp/cus-start.el: Rename display-line-width to
	display-line-number-width.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix tab stops when line numbers are displayed

	* src/xdisp.c (x_produce_glyphs):
	* src/term.c (produce_glyphs): Adjust tab stops for the horizontal
	space taken by the line-number display.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix crashes on TTY frames due to negative lnum_width.

	Don't display line numbers in the minibuffer and in tooltip frames.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix problems with line-number updates in Follow mode

	* src/xdisp.c (redisplay_window): If forced window-start requires
	to move a window's point, and the window is under relative
	line-number display, force another round of redisplay to update
	the relative line numbers.  This fixes follow-mode "redisplay" of
	its window group.

	* lisp/frame.el: Add display-line-numbers to the list of variables
	that should trigger redisplay of the current buffer.

2017-06-24  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix display of line numbers with fonts larger than the default

	* src/xdisp.c (maybe_produce_line_number): Update the metrics in
	IT, not in IT->glyph_row, since the latter gets overwritten in
	display_line.  Fixes display of line numbers when the font used
	for them is larger than that of the default face.

2017-06-23  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix background color beyond EOB and cursor display

	* src/xdisp.c: 	(maybe_produce_line_number): Use the default face
	for background of the blank glyphs in the line-number area which
	are drawn beyond EOB.
	(display_line): Reset the glyph row's displays_text_p flag only on
	empty lines that don't display line numbers.  This fixes cursor
	display beyond EOB.  Fix the bidi information in the glyphs
	produced for line numbers.  Set the avoid_cursor_p flag of glyphs
	produced for line numbers.

2017-06-23  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix display of indicate-empty-lines when line numbers are displayed

	* src/xdisp.c (row_text_area_empty): New function.
	(display_line): Call row_text_area_empty to verify that a glyph
	row's text area is devoid of any glyphs that came from a buffer or
	a string.  This fixes a bug with empty-lines indication
	disappearing when line numbers or line-prefix are displayed.
	(display_line): Delete the argument FORCE; all callers changed.
	Remove the condition for actually producing the glyphs for the
	line number, as even if the number didn't change we need to
	produce empty space.

2017-06-23  Vincent Belaïche  <vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix symbol relocation when the relocated cell is renamed.

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-sym-rowcol):  Check that the renamed cell
	hashmap has been instantiated before getting data from it.  When
	editing several spreadsheets, and you have spreadsheet #1 with a
	cell named `foo', and no renamed cell in spreadsheet #2, then if
	you make a formula with `foo' in spreadsheet #2, not doing this
	check will make an error.
	(ses-cell-set-formula): Robustify versus incorrect cell references
	given in the user provided formula.  An explicit error message is
	provided after the action when the user gives an incorrect cell
	reference, but the formula edition is not changed.  This means that
	if the incorrect reference is to a cell that is created someday,
	then this new cell will not have the edited cell in its reference
	list.  Fixing this can still be done by editing again the first
	cell formula.
	(ses-relocate-symbol): Do not create symbol of referred-to cell
	when this is a renamed cell.

2017-06-23  Rasmus  <rasmus@gmx.us>

	Synchronize with the "emacs-sync" branch from Org

2017-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove getc_unlocked configure-time check

	* configure.ac (getc_unlocked): Remove check, as unlocked-io now
	does this for us.

2017-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use unlocked stdio more systematically

	This can improve performance significantly on stdio-bottlenecked code.

	* admin/merge-gnulib (GNULIB_MODULES): Add unlocked-io.
	* lib-src/ebrowse.c, lib-src/emacsclient.c, lib-src/etags.c:
	* lib-src/hexl.c, lib-src/make-docfile.c, lib-src/movemail.c:
	* lib-src/profile.c, lib-src/update-game-score.c:

	* src/lread.c, src/term.c:
	Include sysstdio.h, possibly instead of stdio.h, to define
	the unlocked functions if the system does not provide them.
	* src/charset.c, src/lread.c (getc_unlocked):
	Remove, since sysstdio.h now defines it if needed.
	* src/cm.c (cmputc, cmcheckmagic):
	* src/dispnew.c (update_frame, update_frame_with_menu)
	(update_frame_1, Fsend_string_to_terminal, Fding, bitch_at_user):
	* src/emacs.c (main, Fdump_emacs):
	* src/fileio.c (Fdo_auto_save, Fset_binary_mode):

	unidata: don’t check special casing in unidata-check  (bug#26656)

	* admin/unidata/unidata-gen.el (unidata-check): Do not test special
	casing mapping of characters since that mapping is not constructed from
	the unidata.txt file.
	Also, check for integer decoder and cons char earlier so that less
	unnecessary processing is performed.

2017-06-22  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/descr-text.el (describe-char): Avoid string-*-multibyte

	Avoid string-to-multibyte and string-as-unibyte.

	Add Org schemas.xml contents to Emacs schemas.xml

	Entries from the Org version of schemas.xml have been added to

	Merge several Lisp reader speedups.

2017-06-22  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Create less garbage to collect while reading symbols.

	* src/lread.c (read1): When interning a symbol, only create a new
	string object for the name if we're going to use it for a new symbol
	object.

2017-06-22  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Replace read_objects assoc list with two hash tables.

	For larger input files with lots of shared data structures, an
	association list is too slow.

	* src/lread.c (read_objects_map, read_objects_completed): New
	variables, replacing read_objects.
	(readevalloop): Initialize them with hash tables before starting a
	top-level read, if they're not already empty hash tables, and reset
	them to Qnil afterwards if something was added to the hash tables.
	(read_internal_start): Likewise.
	(read1): Store first the placeholder and later the newly read object
	into read_objects_map under the specified object number.  If the new
	object can contain a reference to itself, store it in
	read_objects_completed.
	(substitute_objects_recurse): Check read_objects_completed instead of
	read_objects for the known possibly-recursive objects.
	(syms_of_lread): Update initializations.

	(getc_unlocked) [!HAVE_GETC_UNLOCKED]: Fall back to getc.
	* src/lread.c (readbyte_from_file, Fget_file_char, read1,
	getc_unlocked): Likewise.

2017-06-22  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Reduce lread substitutions.

	* src/lread.c (read1): After reading an object using the "#n=" syntax,
	if the read object is a cons cell, instead of recursively substituting
	the placeholder with the new object, mutate the placeholder cons cell
	itself to have the correct car and cdr values.

2017-06-22  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Short-circuit substitutions for some simple types.

	Values that don't contain other values cannot be circular, so checking
	for circular objects is a waste of cycles.

	* src/lread.c (substitute_object_recurse): If the subtree being
	examined is a symbol, number, or property-less string, just return
	it.

2017-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Limit style_format to MAX_ALLOCA

	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Subtract initial buffer size
	from sa_avail, since it is nontrivial.

2017-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Limit bidi_find_bracket_pairs to MAX_ALLOCA

	Shrink it to allow for the two struct bidi_it objects in
	the same frame.
	(PUSH_BPA_STACK): Avoid integer overflow with enormous bidi cache.
	(bidi_find_bracket_pairs): Use compile-time check instead of runtime.

2017-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Limit insert-file-contents to MAX_ALLOCA

	* src/fileio.c (READ_BUF_SIZE): Don’t allocate more than

	Omit unnecessary initialization.

2017-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix temacs hybrid_malloc core dump

	Without this patch, ./temacs would dump core sometimes on Fedora
	25 x86-64.  The problem was that the hybrid allocator assumed that
	all pointers into bss_sbrk_buffer are allocated via gmalloc.  This
	assumption is not true on Fedora, because the standard memory
	allocator calls gdefault_morecore, which means its blocks are
	interleaved with our blocks.  Usually the code happened to work,
	because our data structures agreed with the glibc data structures,
	but this was merely luck due to a shared pedigree, and as glibc
	mutates our luck has run out.
	* src/gmalloc.c (ALLOCATED_BEFORE_DUMPING) [HYBRID_MALLOC]:
	Remove; no longer needed.
	(BLOCK): Use unsigned division, as that does the right thing near zero.
	(register_heapinfo, __malloc_internal_nolock, __free_internal_nolock)
	(_realloc_internal_nolock):
	Big blocks now have type -1, not 0, as 0 now means the block is
	not ours.
	(morecore_nolock): Omit now-unnecessary casts to size_t.
	(allocated_via_gmalloc) [HYBRID_MALLOC]: New function.
	(hybrid_free, hybrid_realloc) [HYBRID_MALLOC]: Use it, to
	avoid calling the wrong free or realloc function in some cases.

2017-06-21  Katsumi Yamaoka  <yamaoka@jpl.org>

	API (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg00960.html),
	but I didn't take it into account when adding the should_quit
	function.

	Instead of duplicating the environment fields or using the C
	preprocessor, use configure to build emacs-module.h.

2017-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Pacify clang without munging C source

	* configure.ac (WARN_CFLAGS): With Clang, use
	-Wno-tautological-compare regardless of --enable-gcc-warnings.
	(WERROR_CFLAGS): Simplify assignments, and guarantee it’s always set.
	* lib/strftime.c: Copy from gnulib, reverting Clang-specific
	change which I hope is no longer needed.
	* src/emacs.c (main): Revert rlim_t change, as rlim_t is signed on
	some older non-POSIX hosts.

2017-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	No need to complicate make-docfile.c for Clang

	Don’t worry about __STDC_VERSION__ in emacs-module

	* src/emacs-module.h: Remove __STDC_VERSION__ check.  In the past
	we’ve found that some compilers do not define this symbol even
	when they work well enough.  If necessary features like stdbool.h
	are missing the compiler will complain eventually anyway.

	Remove some tautological comparisons involving rlim_t

	Clang on macOS warns about these with -Wtautological-compare.  POSIX
	guarantees that rlim_t is
	unsigned (cf.
	http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/sys/resource.h.html),
	so these resource limits can never be negative.

	* src/emacs.c (main): Remove tautological comparisons.

2017-06-14  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Use --module-assertions if modules are available

	Using --module-assertions helps us find bugs in the test module.  But
	we can use it only if Emacs was compiled with module support.

	* test/Makefile.in (MODULES_EMACSOPT): New variable.
	(emacs): Use it.

2017-06-14  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Port cleanup attribute to Oracle Studio 12.5

	* INSTALL (--with-modules): List cleanup attribute as prereq.
	* src/conf_post.h (__has_attribute_cleanup): Remove; no longer needed.
	* src/emacs-module.c (MODULE_SETJMP_1): Don’t attempt to verify
	(__has_attribute (cleanup)), as Oracle Studio 12.5 supports
	__has_attribute only inside preprocessor expressions.  The C
	compiler should check the cleanup attribute in the next line anyway.
	(module_reset_handlerlist): Remove an unnecessary ‘const’
	that causes Oracle Studio 12.5 to refuse to compile.

2017-06-14  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Fix running tests in without-modules builds

	* test/Makefile.in (EMACSOPT): Remove option that is only defined

2017-06-13  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Inline test module Makefile into main test Makefile

	The test/data/emacs-module/Makefile only built a single target, and
	inlining it into test/Makefile simplifies dependency tracking and
	reduces code duplication.

	* configure.ac: Don't build test/data/emacs-module/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in ($(test_module)): Inline compilation.

	(lisp-indent-region-after-string-literal): New test.

2017-06-13  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Fix version checks for emacs-module.h

	We don't need C11 or C++11 because stdbool.h is in C99, and for C++ we

	https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/stdnoreturn_002eh.html
	* src/emacs-module.c: Use _Noreturn, not noreturn.  No need to

2017-06-12  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Implement module assertions for users

	Add a new command-line option '-module-assertions' that users can
	enable developing or debugging a module.  If this option is present,
	Emacs performs additional checks to verify that modules fulfill their
	requirements.  These checks are expensive and crash Emacs if modules
	are invalid, so disable them by default.

	This is a command-line option instead of an ordinary variable because
	changing it while Emacs is running would cause data structure
	imbalances.

	* src/emacs.c (main): New command line option '-module-assertions'.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_assert_main_thread)
	(module_assert_runtime, module_assert_env, module_assert_value):

	the Emacs binary file.

	NULL.

2017-06-12  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Explicitly require C11 or C++11 in emacs-module.h

	We already implicitly require them by including stdbool.h.  Just make
	the error message a bit clearer, and remove an unnecessary version
	comparison.

2017-06-12  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Add missing 'require' forms to prevent compiler warnings.

	* lisp/eshell/esh-ext.el (esh-arg, esh-proc): Add missing

2017-06-11  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Allow non-local exits in module initializers

	Previously signals, throws, and quits from module initialization
	functions were ignored.  These function aren't special, and better
	errors can be reported using signals than with the initialization
	return code, so allow non-local exits.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_signal_or_throw): New helper function.
	(Fmodule_load, funcall_module): Use it.
	(Fmodule_load): Also allow quitting.

2017-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove easserts etc. from emacs-module.c

	Most of these seem to run afoul of the comment "Do NOT use
	'eassert' for checking validity of user code in the module."
	* src/emacs-module.c (MODULE_FUNCTION_BEGIN_NO_CATCH)
	(module_non_local_exit_check, module_non_local_exit_clear)
	(module_non_local_exit_get, module_non_local_exit_signal)
	(module_non_local_exit_throw, module_make_string):
	Remove unnecessary easserts that pointers are nonnull.
	Hardware checks this for us nowadays, and the checks
	just clutter up the code.
	(module_extract_integer): Remove unnecessary verify that
	a C signed integer is in the range INTMAX_MIN..INTMAX_MAX.
	The C standard guarantees this.
	(module_copy_string_contents): Remove unnecessary eassert
	that Lisp strings are null-terminated.
	(module_function_arity): Remove unnecessary easserts that
	function arities are in range.

2017-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove unnecessary checking in emacs-module.c

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_copy_string_contents):
	Remove checking, as string lengths are always nonnegative and less
	than STRING_BYTES_BOUND, and this is checked elsewhere.
	(module_make_string): Check length against STRING_BYTES_BOUND, a
	tighter bound than MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM.  (funcall_module): Don't
	assume that an out-of-range integer is nonnegative.

2017-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	SCHARS and STRING_BYTES are nonnegative

	Tell the compiler that SCHARS and STRING_BYTES are nonnegative, in
	the hopes that this will optimize a bit better.  Also, check this
	at runtime if ENABLE_CHECKING.
	* src/lisp.h (SCHARS, STRING_BYTES):
	eassume that these functions return nonnegative values.
	(STRING_SET_CHARS) [ENABLE_CHECKING]:
	eassert that newsize is nonnegative.

2017-06-05  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Remove an unused error symbol

	* src/emacs-module.c (syms_of_module): Remove unused error symbol
	'invalid-module-call'.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Support quitting in modules

	The idea is that modules should call env->should_quit from time to
	time and return as quickly as possible if it returns true.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_should_quit): New module function.
	(initialize_environment): Use it.
	(funcall_module): Process potential pending quit.

	* src/eval.c (maybe_quit): Add reference to module_should_quit.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Remove an unneeded assertion

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_copy_string_contents): Remove unneeded
	assertion.  If this assertion triggers, we raise an error anyway.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Guard against signed integer overflows

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_extract_integer)
	(module_copy_string_contents, module_make_string): Guard against
	signed integer overflows.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Add a couple more assertions to the module code

	These can help module authors debug crashes.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_non_local_exit_check)
	(module_non_local_exit_clear, module_non_local_exit_get)
	(module_non_local_exit_signal, module_non_local_exit_throw)
	(module_copy_string_contents, module_make_string)
	(funcall_module, initialize_environment): Add assertions

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Use ATTRIBUTE_MAY_ALIAS where alias violations are likely

	In particular, alias violations are likely for the return values of
	dlsym(3), which get cast around arbitrarily.

	* src/emacs-module.c (Fmodule_load): Use ATTRIBUTE_MAY_ALIAS.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Simplify interface of dynlib_attr.

	Instead of returning bool, set the argument pointers to NULL if the
	information is not available.

	* src/dynlib.c (dynlib_addr): Don't return bool.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	other types.

	* src/print.c (print_vectorlike): Add code to print module functions.

	* src/emacs-module.c (funcall_module): Stop calling
	'module_format_fun_env'.  Now that module functions are first-class
	objects, they can be added to signal data directly.
	(module_handle_signal): Remove now-unused function
	'module_format_fun_env'.

	* test/src/emacs-module-tests.el (mod-test-sum-test): Adapt unit test.

	* src/eval.c (funcall_lambda): Adapt call to changed signature of
	'funcall_module'.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Define helper macro to reduce code duplication

	* src/emacs-module.c (MODULE_FUNCTION_BEGIN_NO_CATCH): New helper
	macro.
	(MODULE_FUNCTION_BEGIN, module_type_of, module_is_not_nil, module_eq):
	Use it.

2017-06-04  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Remove two FIXMEs that can't be fixed

2017-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix eldoc bug with curved quote

	* lisp/progmodes/elisp-mode.el (elisp-get-fnsym-args-string):
	Substitute quotes in documentation before returning it (Bug#27159).

2017-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Tune ‘format’ after recent fix

	* doc/lispref/strings.texi (Formatting Strings):
	* src/editfns.c (Fformat): Format field numbers no longer need
	to be unique, reverting the previous doc change since that has
	now been fixed.  Also, document that %% should not have modifiers.
	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Improve performance.  Remove
	the need for the new prepass over the format string, by using
	a typically-more-generous bound for the info array size.
	Initialize the info array lazily.  Move string inspection to
	the same area to help caching.  Avoid the need for a
	converted_to_string bitfield by using EQ.  Cache arg in a
	local and avoid some potential aliasing issues to help the
	compiler.  Info array is now 0-origin, not 1-origin.

2017-06-04  Nikolay Kudryavtsev  <nikolay.kudryavtsev@gmail.com>

	Improve of file-local-name use in vc-git-checkin

	immediately followed by a newline.

	* test/manual/indent/css-mode.css: Add test for the change above.

	* test/manual/indent/scss-mode.scss: Ditto.

2017-06-03  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Fix a bug when using format field numbers

	Previously styled_format overwrite the argument vector.  This is no
	longer possible because there might be more than one specification per
	argument.  Use the existing auxiliary info array instead.

	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Record arguments in the info
	structure instead of overwriting them.
	* test/src/editfns-tests.el (format-with-field): Add unit test.

2017-06-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Document uniqueness limitation of ‘format’

	* doc/lispref/strings.texi (Formatting Strings):
	* src/editfns.c (Fformat):
	Document that field numbers should be unique within a format.

	* admin/authors.el (authors-aliases): Addition.

2017-06-03  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Add watch for password back to inferior python comint filter

	It was removed along with other items for speed (bug#16875),
	but doesn't seem to have been causing an issue, and it's useful to
	have it there (bug#27154).
	* lisp/progmodes/python.el (inferior-python-mode):
	Add comint-watch-for-password-prompt to comint-output-filter-functions.

2017-06-03  Ryan  <rct@thompsonclan.org>  (tiny change)

	Use completing-read-default in tmm-prompt

	tmm uses completing-read, but customizes its behavior so much
	that any alternative completing-read-function will almost
	certainly break it.  For example, both ido-ubiquitous and ivy have
	special code to deactivate themselves for tmm.
	* lisp/tmm.el (tmm-prompt): Use completing-read-default instead of
	completing-read.  (Bug#27193)

2017-06-02  Mats Lidell  <mats.lidell@cag.se>

2017-06-02  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Update TUTORIAL.he

2017-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Limit format fields to more POSIX-like spec

	* doc/lispref/strings.texi (Formatting Strings):
	Don’t allow mixing numbered with unnumbered format specs.
	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Don’t bother checking for field 0,
	since it doesn’t crash and the behavior is not specified.
	* test/src/editfns-tests.el (format-with-field): Adjust tests to
	match current doc.  Add more tests for out-of-range fields.

2017-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/editfns.c (str2num): New function.
	(styled_format): Use it instead of strtoumax.  Use ptrdiff_t
	instead of uintmax_t.  Check for integer overflow.
	* src/lread.c (LEAD_INT, DOT_CHAR, TRAIL_INT, E_EXP):
	Move to private scope and make them enums.
	(string_to_number): Compute integer value directly during
	first pass instead of revisiting it with strtoumax later.

2017-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Minor improvements to format field numbers

	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Allow field numbers in a %% spec.
	No need for a special diagnostic for field numbers greater than
	PTRDIFF_MAX.  Reword diagnostic for field 0.
	* test/src/editfns-tests.el (format-with-field): Adjust to match.

2017-06-02  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Implement field numbers in format strings

	A field number explicitly specifies the argument to be formatted.
	This is especially important for potential localization work, since
	grammars of various languages dictate different word orders.

	* src/editfns.c (Fformat): Update documentation.
	(styled_format): Implement field numbers.

	* doc/lispref/strings.texi (Formatting Strings): Document field numbers.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-format-warn): Adapt.

2017-06-01  Alexander Gramiak  <agrambot@gmail.com>

	Limit scope of local overriding-terminal-local-map

	The function `binding' may call isearch-done, which globally sets
	overriding-terminal-local-map to nil (Bug#23007).
	* lisp/isearch.el (isearch-mouse-2): Don't bind
	overriding-terminal-local-map around the call to `binding'.

2017-06-01  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Correct and isolate the todo-mode test environment

	This avoids having to set todo-mode variables globally in the test
	file and prevents any exisiting user todo-mode files from influencing
	the tests.

	* test/lisp/calendar/todo-mode-tests.el:
	(with-todo-test): New macro.
	(todo-test-todo-quit01, todo-test-todo-quit02)

	* src/xdisp.c (init_iterator): When hscrolling only the
	current line, apply the	window's min_hscroll here, so that
	non-current lines will be hscrolled by that minimum.
	Suggested by Stephen Berman <stephen.berman@gmx.net>.
	(hscroll_window_tree): Account for window's min_hscroll when
	deciding whether to recompute the hscroll.
	(display_line): Subtract window's min_hscroll from x_incr, as that

2017-05-31  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Further simplify test/Makefile, optionally load elc tests

	* test/Makefile.in: Use make's error ignoring feature instead of

2017-05-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Skip .#* temporaries when finding sources

	Without this patch, ‘make check’ can fail with the diagnostic
	‘invalid syntax in conditional’ if there is an Emacs temporary
	file whose name starts with ‘.#’, because the ‘#’ is treated as
	the start of a Make comment.
	* lisp/Makefile.in (loaddefs, tagsfiles, check-defun-deps):
	* test/Makefile.in (ELFILES):
	Skip files starting with ‘.’, so that the .#* files do not cause
	trouble.  (We cannot easily skip just files starting with ‘.#’,
	since ‘#’ starts a Make comment!)

	(eldoc-mode): Only show the message when called interactively.

2017-05-29  Dmitry Gutov  <dgutov@yandex.ru>

	Use regexp matching instead of checking exit status

2017-05-29  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Add initial tests for todo-mode.el

	*test/lisp/calendar/todo-mode-tests.el:
	*test/lisp/calendar/todo-mode-resources/todo-test-1.toda:
	*test/lisp/calendar/todo-mode-resources/todo-test-1.todo: New files.

	* .gitattributes: Ignore trailing whitespace in todo-mode test
	data files, since it is part of the todo-mode file format.

2017-05-29  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Make `todo-toggle-item-highlighting' work on multiline items (bug#27133)

	* lisp/calendar/todo-mode.el (todo-hl-line-range): New named function,
	replacing an anonymous function for the sake of `describe-variable'.
	(todo-modes-set-2): Use it as buffer-local value of hl-line-range-function
	and remove boundp test of this variable, so its value is available on

	  what users are actually looking for.

2017-05-29  Wilfred Hughes  <me@wilfred.me.uk>

	Ensure button-get works in any buffer

	* lisp/button.el (button-get): Previously we assumed that button-get
	  was called in the buffer containing the button.  In other buffers,
	  button-get always returned nil.  Fix this by passing the relevant
	  buffer from the marker.

2017-05-29  Dmitry Gutov  <dgutov@yandex.ru>

	Signal error if find-grep returns a nonzero status

	* lisp/progmodes/xref.el (xref-collect-matches): Signal error
	if find-grep returns a nonzero status (bug#23451).  Remove the
	comment: even if some output is present, a non-zero status
	means something went wrong and it can't be relied upon.

2017-05-29  Stephen Berman  <stephen.berman@gmx.net>

	Make sure exiting todo-mode buffer buries it (bug#27121)

	This failed due to commit ea3ae33b from 2013-05-16, which prevented
	quitting todo-mode buffer after visiting todo-archive buffer from
	making the archive buffer current again.  Avoid this now by simply
	killing the archive buffer, since there's no need to keep it a live
	buffer.  Consequently, quitting a todo-mode buffer can now use
	bury-buffer without an argument, which ensures that is will not
	becomes current on quitting the buffer that replaced it in the window.

	* lisp/calendar/todo-mode.el (todo-quit): Kill todo-archive-mode
	buffer instead of burying it.  This now allows exiting the
	todo-mode buffer by bury-buffer without an argument, so do that.

2017-05-28  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Some tweaks, almost all for Tramp adb method

	(tramp-adb-maybe-open-connection): Set "prompt" property.
	(tramp-adb-wait-for-output): Use it.

	* lisp/net/tramp-cache.el (tramp-cache-print): Use `elt'.
	(tramp-dump-connection-properties): Check also that there are
	properties to be saved.  Don't save "started" property of
	"ftp" method.

	* lisp/net/tramp-gvfs.el (tramp-gvfs-handle-expand-file-name):
	Use `make-tramp-file-name'.

	* lisp/net/tramp.el (tramp-remote-file-name-spec-regexp):
	Host could be empty.

	* test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el (tramp-test03-file-name-defaults):
	Revert change from 2017-05-24.
	(tramp-test05-expand-file-name-relative): Let it also pass for
	"adb" method.

2017-05-28  Jürgen Hötzel  <juergen@archlinux.org>

	(tramp-adb-ls-toolbox-regexp):
	Ignore addition links column on Android 7.
	(tramp-adb-get-ls-command):
	Dont use --color=none when using toybox (Android 7).  It's not
	possible to disable coloring explicitly for toybox ls.

2017-05-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Depromiscuify inotify with IN_MASK_ADD

	Use IN_MASK_ADD instead of using a no-longer-promiscuous-enough
	mask.  This simplifies the code and restores the ability to
	use IN_ACCESS, IN_CLOSE_WRITE, IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE, and IN_OPEN
	in some cases (Bug#26973).
	* src/inotify.c (INOTIFY_DEFAULT_MASK): Remove.
	(Finotify_add_watch): Use IN_MASK_ADD instead.

2017-05-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Restore inotify onlydir support

	There was no need to remove it in the 2017-03-26 inotify change,
	as it is like IN_DONT_FOLLOW and does not affect other watchers
	for the same file.
	* src/inotify.c (symbol_to_inotifymask, Finotify_add_watch)
	(syms_of_inotify): Bring back onlydir.

2017-05-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify computation of inotify mask

	* src/inotify.c (add_watch): Accept uint32_t imask instead

	Don't attempt to recover from undefined behavior in some cases

	These functions can only be run in batch mode and exit Emacs on
	return, so nothing can be recovered.  Disable unsafe recover

	Avoid another compiler warning on macOS

	When configured with --without-ns, HAVE_NS is not defined on macOS,
	thus 'memory-limit' calls the deprecated sbrk(2) function.  Avoid that
	by using the pre-defined __APPLE__ preprocessor macro.

	* src/alloc.c (Fmemory_limit): Never use sbrk(2) on macOS.

	Make ff-find-other-file symmetric for C++ (Bug#20192)

	`cc-other-file-alist' has a mapping of file extensions to switch

	(funcall_module): Avoid unnecessary conversion to EMACS_INT.
	(module_function_arity): Allow arities greater than SHRT_MAX.

2017-05-20  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Reimplement module functions

	Instead of a lambda, create a new type containing all data required to
	call the function, and support it in the evaluator.  Because this type
	now also needs to store the function documentation, it is too big for
	Lisp_Misc; use a pseudovector instead.  That also has the nice benefit
	that we don't have to add special support to the garbage collector.

	Since the new type is user-visible, give it a predicate.

	Now we can easily support 'help-function-args' and 'func-arity'; add
	unit tests for these.

	* src/lisp.h (allocate_module_function, MODULE_FUNCTIONP)
	(XMODULE_FUNCTION): New pseudovector type 'module function'.

	* src/eval.c (FUNCTIONP): Also treat module functions as functions.
	(funcall_lambda, Ffuncall, eval_sub): Add support for calling module
	functions.
	(Ffunc_arity): Add support for detecting the arity of module
	functions.

	* src/emacs-module.c (module_make_function): Adapt to new structure.
	Return module function object directly instead of wrapping it in a
	lambda; remove FIXME.
	(funcall_module): New function to call module functions.  Replaces
	`internal--module-call' and is called directly from eval.c.
	(syms_of_module): Remove internal helper function, which is no longer
	needed.
	(module_function_arity): New helper function.

	* src/data.c (Ftype_of): Adapt to new implementation.
	(Fmodule_function_p, syms_of_data): New user-visible function.  Now
	that module functions are first-class objects, they deserve a
	predicate.  Define it even if not compiled with --enable-modules so
	that Lisp code doesn't have to check for the function's existence.

	* src/doc.c (Fdocumentation): Support module functions.

	* src/print.c (print_object): Adapt to new implementation.

	* src/alloc.c (mark_object): Specialized garbage collector support is
	no longer needed.

	* lisp/help.el (help-function-arglist): Support module functions.
	While there, simplify the arity calculation by using `func-arity',
	which does the right thing for all kinds of functions.

	* test/data/emacs-module/mod-test.c: Amend docstring so we can test
	the argument list.

	* test/src/emacs-module-tests.el (mod-test-sum-docstring): Adapt to
	new docstring.
	(mod-test-non-local-exit-signal-test): Because `internal--module-call'
	is gone, the backtrace has changed and no longer leaks the
	implementation.
	(module--func-arity): New test for `func-arity'.
	(module--help-function-arglist): New test for `help-function-arglist'.

2017-05-20  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix automatic hscrolling of only the current line

	* src/xdisp.c (display_line): When hscrolling only the current
	line, increment iterator's first_visible_x and last_visible_x
	values to account for the hscroll.  This propagates the hscroll
	effect on the iterator geometry all the way down to the
	subroutines called by display_line, and avoids scrolling bugs
	under large hscroll values.  (Bug#26994)

	Check that signed right shift is arithmetic

	* src/data.c (ash_lsh_impl): Verify that signed right shift is

	Don't require bytecomp for running ert tests

	"Fix ert-tests when running compiled" 2016-12-06 accidentally
	introduced a dependency on `bytecomp' into `ert'.  As mentioned in
	"Avoid ert test failures" 2017-04-18, the accidental dependency of ert
	on bytecomp was masked by loading other libraries until recently.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/ert.el (ert--expand-should-1): Only use
	`byte-compile-macro-environment' if it's bound.
	* test/src/eval-tests.el: Add defvar for dynamic variable
	`byte-compile-debug'.

2017-04-23  Andrew G Cohen  <cohen@andy.bu.edu>

	Allow limiting gnus summary buffers to a thread

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-sum.el (gnus-summary-limit-include-thread): Include
	an optional argument to allow limiting the summary buffer to just the
	thread-related articles.
	(gnus-refer-thread-limit-to-thread): Introduce customizable variable
	to control whether thread-referral adds the thread to the summary
	buffer or limits to just the thread.
	(gnus-summary-refer-thread): Use the new variable.

2017-04-23  Andrew G Cohen  <cohen@andy.bu.edu>

	Correct gnus-newsgroup-limits in gnus when including thread

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-sum.el (gnus-summary-limit-include-thread): Should
	only add one list of thread-related articles to gnus-newsgroup-limits
	rather than two.

2017-04-23  Andrew G Cohen  <cohen@andy.bu.edu>

	Improve gnus thread matching of similar subjects

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-sum.el (gnus-summary-limit-include-thread):
	Use the more liberal gnus-general-simplify-subject regexp to
	find thread articles with similar subjects.

2017-04-22  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Add new `lisp-indent-region' that doesn't reparse the code.

	Both `lisp-indent-region' and `lisp-indent-line' now use `syntax-ppss'
	to get initial state, so they will no longer indent string literal
	contents.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/lisp-mode.el (lisp-ppss): New function, like
	`syntax-ppss', but with a more dependable item 2.
	(lisp-indent-region): New function, like `indent-region-line-by-line'
	but additionally keep a running parse state to avoid reparsing the
	code repeatedly.  Use `lisp-ppss' to get initial state.
	(lisp-indent-line): Take optional PARSE-STATE argument, pass it to
	`calculate-lisp-indent', use `lisp-ppss' if not given.
	(lisp-mode-variables): Set `indent-region-function' to
	`lisp-indent-region'.

2017-04-22  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Remove ignored argument from lisp-indent-line

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/lisp-mode.el (lisp-indent-line): Remove WHOLE-EXP
	argument, the behavior has long since been handled in
	`indent-for-tab-command'.  Also remove redundant `beg' and `shift-amt'
	variables and use `indent-line-to'.

2017-04-22  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/lisp-mode.el (indent-sexp): Clean up marker.

2017-04-22  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't reparse the sexp in indent-sexp (Bug#25122)

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/lisp-mode.el (calculate-lisp-indent): Let
	PARSE-START be a parse state that can be reused.
	(indent-sexp): Pass the running parse state to calculate-lisp-indent
	instead of the sexp beginning position.  Saving the
	CONTAINING-SEXP-START returned by `calculate-lisp-indent' is no longer
	needed.  Don't bother stopping if we don't descend below init-depth,
	since we now alway scan the whole buffer (via syntax-ppss) anyway.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/lisp-mode-tests.el (indent-sexp): Add blank
	line to test case.

2017-04-22  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	Add cond test cases for singleton clauses.

	  the default clause is a single non-nil expression.

2017-04-22  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	b-c--cond-jump-table-info: Use correct body for singleton clauses

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-cond-jump-table-info):
	When a clause's body consists of a single constant expression, use
	that expression as the body to be compiled. This fixes switch bytecode
	evaluating to nil to such clauses.

2017-04-22  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	ffap: Don't switch window unless needed

	When using ffap-other-window, don't change the window configuration

	* lisp/ffap.el (ffap-other-frame): Don't change the window
	configuration if no new buffer has been created.
	* test/lisp/ffap-tests.el (ffap-other-window--bug-25352): Add unit
	test.

	Revert 0d112c00ba0ec14bd3014efcd3430b9ddcfe1fc1 (to fix bug#26325)
	and use a different fix for bug#26068.
	(cl--symbol-macro-key): New function.
	(cl--sm-macroexpand, cl-symbol-macrolet): Use it instead of `symbol-name`.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-lib-tests.el (cl-lib-symbol-macrolet):
	Failure is not expected any more.

	Treat non-erroring lisp call as successful eshell command (Bug#26161)

	This lets a compound command like 'cd .. && echo ok' print 'ok',
	similar to how most other shells behave.

	* lisp/eshell/esh-cmd.el (eshell-exit-success-p): Only check if the
	last exit code was zero, rather than first checking whether the last
	command returned nil.
	(eshell-exec-lisp): Set `eshell-last-command-status' to 1 on error.

2017-04-21  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Fix reading of tab settings in whitespace-mode

	lisp/whitespace.el (whitespace-indent-tabs-mode)
	whitespace-tab-width): Remove these variables. The underlying
	variables `indent-tabs-mode' and `tab-width' are already buffer-local
	when needed, and whitespace-mode never changes them.
	(whitespace-ensure-local-variables): Remove this function, which only
	existed to set the above variables.
	(whitespace-cleanup-region, whitespace-regexp)
	(whitespace-indentation-regexp, whitespace-report-region)
	(whitespace-turn-on, whitespace-color-on): Adjust these functions to
	use `indent-tabs-mode' and `tab-width' directly, and not call
	`whitespace-ensure-local-variables'.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-unfold-bcf): Don't inline
	  FORM if the bytecode uses the byte-switch instruction. It is
	  impossible to guess the correct stack depth while inlining such
	  bytecode, resulting in faulty code.

2017-04-20  Nicolas Petton  <nicolas@petton.fr>

	completion for `info-menu`.

2017-04-19  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Remove some explicit runtime loads of pcase

	Pcase is macros, so these should have used eval-when-compile.
	Anyway, pcase entry points are autoloaded, so the compiler handles it.
	* lisp/profiler.el, lisp/emacs-lisp/eieio-core.el:
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/generator.el, lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el:
	* lisp/progmodes/xref.el: No need to require pcase.

2017-04-19  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Stop cl-lib loading pcase at runtime

	The cause was an unexpanded pcase-defmacro in cl-loaddefs.
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/autoload.el (make-autoload):
	Treat pcase-defmacro like defmacro.

	Fix bugs in `with-displayed-buffer-window' and `fit-window-to-buffer'

	* lisp/window.el (with-displayed-buffer-window): When a
	'window-height' action alist entry specifies a function, call
	`temp-buffer-window-show' with a '(window-height . t)' dummy
	entry so `window--try-to-split-window' will bind
	`window-combination-limit' to t and that function does not
	resize any other window but the one we split this one off
	(Bug#25055, Bug#25179).
	(fit-window-to-buffer): Call `window-max-delta' with NOUP t so
	we steal space only from windows in the same combination.
	Stealing space from other windows would not allow us to return
	that space later when this window is deleted (Bug#25055,
	Bug#25179).

2017-04-10  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Fix a loop in C Mode caused by inadequate analysis of comments.

	After M-;, and the insertion of the opening "/*", the CC Mode after-change
	function got confused, since the new comment opener matched the end of a
	subsequent comment, but moving back over that comment did not come back to the
	starting point.  Fix this.

	point is left if no end-of-macro is found before it.

	non-nil except where we have an unclosed block comment at the end of a macro.
	This enables us to populate the cache more fully, at the cost of some run
	time.

2017-04-06  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Implement special sigma casing rule  (bug#24603)

	In Greek, a sigma character has two lower case forms which depend on
	their position in the word.  Implement logic determining it.

	* src/casefiddle.c (struct casing_context, case_character_impl): Don’t
	assume inword is true when flag is CASE_UP and false when flag is
	CASE_DOWN.  For final sigma detection we need this information tracked
	reliably;.
	(CAPITAL_SIGMA, SMALL_SIGMA, SMALL_FINAL_SIGMA): New macros defining
	Unicode code point of different forms of sigma letter.
	(case_character): Implement support for final sigma casing.
	(do_casify_multibyte_string, do_casify_multibyte_region): Update after
	changes to case_character.

	* test/src/casefiddle-tests.el (casefiddle-tests-casing): Add test
	cases for final sigma.

2017-04-06  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Support casing characters which map into multiple code points  (bug#24603)

	Implement unconditional special casing rules defined in Unicode standard.

	Among other things, they deal with cases when a single code point is
	replaced by multiple ones because single character does not exist (e.g.
	‘ﬁ’ ligature turning into ‘FL’) or is not commonly used (e.g. ß turning
	into SS).

	* admin/unidata/SpecialCasing.txt: New data file pulled from Unicode
	standard distribution.
	* admin/unidata/README: Mention SpecialCasing.txt.

	* admin/unidata/unidata-gen.el (unidata-gen-table-special-casing,
	unidata-gen-table-special-casing--do-load): New functions generating
	‘special-uppercase’, ‘special-lowercase’ and ‘special-titlecase’
	character Unicode properties built from the SpecialCasing.txt Unicode
	data file.

	* src/casefiddle.c (struct casing_str_buf): New structure for
	representing short strings used to handle one-to-many character
	mappings.

	(case_character_imlp): New function which can handle one-to-many
	character mappings.
	(case_character, case_single_character): Wrappers for the above
	functions.  The former may map one character to multiple (or no)
	code points while the latter does what the former used to do (i.e.
	handles one-to-one mappings only).

	(do_casify_natnum, do_casify_unibyte_string,
	do_casify_unibyte_region): Use case_single_character.
	(do_casify_multibyte_string, do_casify_multibyte_region): Support new
	features of case_character.
	* (do_casify_region): Updated to reflact do_casify_multibyte_string
	changes.

	(casify_word): Handle situation when one character-length of a word
	can change affecting where end of the word is.

	(upcase, capitalize, upcase-initials): Update documentation to mention
	limitations when working on characters.

	* test/src/casefiddle-tests.el (casefiddle-tests-char-properties):
	Add test cases for the newly introduced character properties.
	(casefiddle-tests-casing): Update test cases which are now passing.

	* test/lisp/char-fold-tests.el (char-fold--ascii-upcase,
	char-fold--ascii-downcase): New functions which behave like old ‘upcase’
	and ‘downcase’.
	(char-fold--test-match-exactly): Use the new functions.  This is needed
	because otherwise ﬁ and similar characters are turned into their multi-
	-character representation.

	* doc/lispref/strings.texi: Describe issue with casing characters versus
	strings.
	* doc/lispref/nonascii.texi: Describe the new character properties.

2017-04-06  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Split up casify_region function  (bug#24603)

	No functional changes at this time but splitting casify_region into
	a function dealing with multibyte and another dealing with unibyte
	buffers will make future code changes slightly easier.

	* src/casefiddle.c (casify_region): Move most of the code into two
	new functions:
	(do_casify_multibyte_region, do_casify_unibyte_region): new functions.

2017-04-06  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Add support for title-casing letters  (bug#24603)

	* src/casefiddle.c (struct casing_context, prepare_casing_context): Add
	titlecase_char_table member.  It’s set to the ‘titlecase’ Unicode
	property table if capitalisation has been requested.
	(case_character): Make use of the titlecase_char_table to title-case
	initial characters when capitalising.

	* test/src/casefiddle-tests.el (casefiddle-tests--characters,
	casefiddle-tests-casing): Update test cases which are now passing.

2017-04-06  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Introduce case_character function

	Move single-character casing logic into a separate function so that
	it is collected in a single place.  This will make future changes to
	the logic easier.  This commit introduces no functionality changes.

	* src/casefiddle.c (struct casing_context, prepare_casing_context): New
	sturcture for saving casing context and function to initialise it.
	(case_character): New function which cases character base on provided
	context.
	(do_casify_integer, do_casify_multibyte_string,
	do_casify_unibyte_string, casify_object, casify_region): Convert to
	use casing_context and case_character.

2017-04-06  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Split casify_object into multiple functions

	casify_object had three major cases to cover and those were mostly
	independent of each other.  Move those branches to separate function
	so it’s easier to comprehend each individual case.

	While at it, use somewhat more descriptive ch and cased variable names
	rather than c and c1.

	This commit introduces no functional changes.

	* src/casefiddle.c (casify_object): Split into…
	(do_casify_integer, do_casify_multibyte_string,
	do_casify_unibyte_string): …new functions.

2017-04-06  Lars Brinkhoff  <lars@nocrew.org>

	Update documentation for type semantics of records.

	* doc/lispref/objects.texi (Record Type): improve description of what
	`type-of' returns for records.
	(Type Descriptors): new section.
	* doc/lispref/elisp.texi: reference it.
	* doc/lispref/records.texi (Records): reference it.  Document
	behaviour when type slot is a record.

	* admin/alloc-colors.c (Fmake_record, Frecord): mention type desciptors.

2017-04-06  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

2017-04-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	In CANNOT_DUMP builds, allow editing of files named "dump".

	* lisp/loadup.el: Perform the "dump" or "bootstrap" actions like
	calling dump-emacs only if dump-emacs is defined; otherwise, don't
	treat those command-line argument specially.

2017-04-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	In CANNOT_DUMP builds, don't prepare for unexec.

	Having a command-line argument of "dump" or "bootstrap" would trigger
	behavior like not installing signal handlers.  In CANNOT_DUMP modes,
	we should get signal handlers installed regardless of whatever funny
	file names we decide to edit.

	src/emacs.c (main) [CANNOT_DUMP]: Don't enable the "dumping"
	alterations to initialization that prepares the process for unexec.

2017-04-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Allow a CANNOT_DUMP build to use exec-path during bootstrap.

	During a bootstrap, loading rmail.el invokes movemail to determine its
	flavor, but call-process doesn't work if exec-path is nil.

	* lisp/loadup.el: Only clear exec-path if dumping.

2017-04-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Fix CANNOT_DUMP build on Darwin/macOS.

	* src/conf_post.h (malloc, realloc, free) [DARWIN_OS && emacs &&
	CANNOT_DUMP]: Don't define as unexec_malloc, etc.
	* src/emacs.c (main): Don't call unexec_init_emacs_zone.

	Minor simplifications and doc for records

	* doc/lispref/records.texi (Records): Mention size limit.
	* etc/NEWS: Mention records.
	* src/alloc.c (allocate_pseudovector, allocate_record):
	Prefer 'PSEUDOVECTOR_SIZE_MASK' to its definiens.

	virtual environment.
	See following link for details:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-03/msg00857.html
	* test/lisp/progmodes/python-tests.el

	bind it to '/env'.

2017-04-04  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Throw a `search-failed' derived error in Info search

	The original fix for Bug#6106 switched from signalling `search-failed'
	to `user-error'.  However, this breaks incremental searching over
	multiple nodes because the isearch code doesn't expect a `user-error'.

	with `user-error' and `search-failed' as parents.
	* doc/lispref/errors.texi (Standard Errors): Document it.
	* etc/NEWS: Announce it.
	* lisp/info.el (Info-search): Use it instead of `user-error' so that
	isearch will handle failed searches correctly.

	* test/Makefile.in (LOGFILES, TESTS): Omit leading "./".
	(TESTS): Omit unnecessary patsubst.
	(test_template): Redo dependency heuristic, hopefully
	correctly this time.  It's the .log file that depends,
	not the phony test target.  Declare the phonies to be PHONY.
	Resurrect the exception for the *-tests subdirectory.
	Adjust to the fact that leading "./" is omitted now.

	Simplify test dependency generation

	Generate default dependencies by using GNU extensions to ‘make’

	c-new-BEG or c-new-END when there is no need.
	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Add "CASE 17.5" to implement the "asymmetric
	space" rule.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el (c-get-fontification-context): New function,
	extracted from c-font-lock-declarations.  Add to this function processing to
	make `context' 'decl for lines contained within parens when these are also
	declarations.
	(c-font-lock-declarations): Call the newly extracted function above in place
	of inline code.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-mode.el (c-fl-decl-start): Set point before calling
	c-literal-start.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-vars.el (c-asymmetry-fontification-flag): New user option.

	* doc/misc/cc-mode.texi (Misc Font Locking): New node documenting the new

2017-03-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Some inotify cleanup

	This catches some problems with integer overflow and races
	that I noticed in inotify.c after reviewing the changes
	installed to fix Bug#26126.
	* src/fns.c, src/lisp.h (equal_no_quit): Now extern.
	* src/inotify.c (aspect_to_inotifymask):
	Check for cycles and for improper lists.
	(make_lispy_mask, lispy_mask_match_p): Remove.
	All callers changed to use INTEGER_TO_CONS and CONS_TO_INTEGER.
	(inotifyevent_to_event, add_watch):
	Don’t assume watch descriptors and cookies fit in fixnums.
	(add_watch): Use assoc_no_quit, not Fassoc.
	Avoid integer overflow in (very!) long-running processes where
	the Emacs watch ID could overflow.  Avoid some duplicate code.
	(find_descriptor): New function.
	(remove_descriptor): First arg is now the returned value from
	find_descriptor, rather than the descriptor.  This way, the
	value can be removed without calling Fdelete, which might quit.
	Wait until the end (when watch_list is consistent) before signaling
	any errors.
	(remove_watch, inotify_callback):
	Use find_descriptor to avoid the need for Fdelete.
	(inotify_callback): Use simpler tests for ioctl failure.
	Free temporary buffer if signaled, and put it on the stack if small.
	Use ssize_t to index through read results, to avoid a cast.
	(valid_watch_descriptor): New function, with a tighter check.
	(Finotify_rm_watch, Finotify_valid_p): Use it.
	(Finotify_valid_p): Use assoc_no_quit and ass_no_quit instead
	of Fassoc.  Do not assume the first assoc succeeds.
	* test/src/inotify-tests.el (inotify-valid-p-simple):
	Add inotify-valid-p tests, some of which dump core without
	the fixes noted above.

2017-03-30  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* lisp/net/tramp-sh.el (tramp-get-remote-locale): Add "C.UTF-8" as candidate.

	* lisp/cedet/semantic/wisent/wisent.el (wisent-automaton-p): Use obarrayp.

2017-03-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix assoc_no_quit so that it does not quit

	The problem was that it called Fequal, which can quit.
	* src/fns.c (enum equal_kind):
	New enum, to be used in place of a boolean.
	(equal_no_quit): New function.
	(Fmemql, Feql): Use it to compare floats, as a minor tuneup.
	(assoc_no_quit): Use it to avoid quitting, the main point here.
	(internal_equal): Generalize bool to enum equal_kind arg, so that
	there are now 3 possibilities instead of 2.  Do not signal an
	error if EQUAL_NO_QUIT.  Put the arg before the depth, since depth
	should be irrelevant if the arg is EQUAL_NO_QUIT.  All callers
	changed.

2017-03-29  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Amend gitmerge to recognize the injunction "don't merge".

	* admin/gitmerge.el (gitmerge-skip-regexp): amend regexp to match "don't" as

2017-03-29  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Adjust some search failure errors in info.el

	* lisp/info.el (Info-select-node): The search for beginning of node is
	an internal detail, and is not normally expected to fail, so it should
	not be a user error.
	(Info-complete-menu-item): Failing to find a menu indicates the user
	searched for a menu when there isn't one, so change to `use-error'.

2017-03-28  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-defs.el (c-version):  Restore c-version to 5.33

2017-03-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don’t mishandle (format "%i" -1.0)

	(Info-select-node, Info-search): Replace (signal 'search-failed ...)
	with (user-error "Search failed: "...).

2017-03-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix obsolete ‘test/automated’ references

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean, clean, maybeclean_dirs, distclean)
	(bootstrap-clean, maintainer-clean):
	Clean ‘test’, not ‘test/automated’.  Test for existence of
	subdirectory only for ‘test’, not for directories that should
	always exist.
	* admin/MAINTAINERS, etc/TODO, lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el:
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el, lisp/emacs-lisp/thunk.el:

	Add check for expected backtrace in module calls.

	* test/manual/cedet/tests/test.el

	(tramp-register-autoload-file-name-handlers)
	(tramp-register-file-name-handlers): Do not handle

	the handlers are responsible for.
	(tramp-register-foreign-file-name-handler): New defun.

2017-03-26  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix docstring of dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp

	* lisp/dabbrev.el (dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp): Using a value of nil
	is equivalent to "\\sw\\|\\s_", and has no special behavior.  If the
	previous character doesn't match, we search backwards for one that
	does, not throw an error.  Replace Lisp example with C based one to
	make it clear that "symbol" means a sequence of word and symbol
	constituent characters, not a Lisp symbol (Bug#358).

2017-03-26  Johan Claesson  <johanclaesson@bredband.net>  (tiny change)

	Protect against an infloop in python-mode

	There appears to be an edge case caused by using `syntax-ppss' in a
	narrowed buffer during JIT lock inside of Python triple-quote strings.
	Unfortunately it is impossible to reproduce without manually
	destroying the syntactic information in the Python buffer, but it has
	been observed in practice.  In that case it can happen that the syntax
	caches get sufficiently out of whack so that there appear to be
	overlapping strings in the buffer.  As Python has no nested strings,
	this situation is impossible and leads to an infloop in
	`python-nav-end-of-statement'.  Protect against this by checking
	whether the search for the end of the current string makes progress.

	* lisp/progmodes/python.el (python-nav-end-of-statement): Protect
	against infloop.
	* lisp/progmodes/python-tests.el
	(python-tests--python-nav-end-of-statement--infloop): Add unit test.

	* lib/Makefile.in, lwlib/Makefile.in, oldXMenu/Makefile.in:
	* src/Makefile.in: Adjust deps strategies to be similar, as follows:

	Modification hooks should be enabled while modifying text in the
	org-src temp buffer, but in 2017-01-29 "Call modification hooks in

	Although this problem has been with us for a while, the recent

	* configure.ac (AUTO_DEPEND): When autodepending, clean out any
	leftover dependency and object files, since the previous sources'

	Fixups for GNU Make switchover

	This fixes some minor problems introduced in the recent switch to GNU
	Make, discovered by further testing.  Without some of these changes
	'make -j' would sometimes have race conditions caused by missing
	dependencies.  (Bug#26100)
	* .gitignore: Remove src/stamp-h.in, src/stamp-h1.
	* Makefile.in ($(MAKEFILE_NAME)): Depend on configure, not
	src/config.in, since the former's timestamp now represents
	the latter's.
	($(srcdir)/configure): Use plain ./autogen.sh, for consistency
	with other autogen.sh invocations.
	($(srcdir)/src/stamp-h.in):
	Remove rule, as this file is no longer created.
	* Makefile.in (top_distclean):
	* src/Makefile.in (bootstrap-clean):
	No need to remove stamp-h1, as that was an Automake byproduct
	and Automake is no longer in use.
	* lib/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in:
	(AUTOCONF_INPUTS, $(top_srcdir)/configure): Remove.
	(../config.status, Makefile): Simplify by limiting dependencies
	to files we care about and files in the repository, and by
	using just one file to represent the timestamps on multiple
	targets updated by the same rule.
	* autogen.sh: Do not create or use src/stamp-h.in.
	Instead, have 'find' test the two output files directly.

2017-03-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Switch from Automake to GNU Make

	Emacs assumes GNU Make, and GNU Make has much of the functionality of
	Automake built-in.  The Emacs build process uses Automake primarily
	because Emacs uses some Gnulib code and Gnulib formerly required
	Automake.  Now that Gnulib no longer requires Automake, Emacs can
	stop using Automake and this should simplify Emacs maintenance
	in the future (Bug#26100).  Although this patch may look long, most of
	it is generated automatically: the changes to build-aux/config.guess,
	build-aux/config.sub, build-aux/install-sh, and lib/gnulib.mk.in are
	all done by admin/merge-gnulib.
	* .gitignore: Remove build-aux/ar-lib, build-aux/compile,
	build-aux/config.guess, build-aux/config.sub, build-aux/depcomp,
	build-aux/install-sh, build-aux/missing, and lib/Makefile.in,
	as they are no longer built by autogen.sh.
	Add lib/gnulib.mk, as it is now built by 'configure'.
	Remove nt/gnulib.mk, as it is no longer built by 'make'.
	* INSTALL.REPO, README, admin/make-tarball.txt:
	Remove mention of Automake.
	* Makefile.in (AUTOCONF, AUTOMAKE, AUTOHEADER, ACLOCAL, lib)
	(AUTOCONF_INPUTS, ACLOCAL_PATH, ACLOCAL_INPUTS)
	($(srcdir)/aclocal.m4, AUTOMAKE_INPUTS)
	($(srcdir)/lib/Makefile.in, $(srcdir)/nt/gnulib.mk, am--refresh):
	Remove.
	($(MAKEFILE_NAME)): Depend on lib/gnulib.mk.in.
	($(srcdir)/configure, $(srcdir)/src/stamp-h.in)
	($(srcdir)/src/config.in):
	Use autogen.sh instead of doing it by hand.
	* admin/merge-gnulib (AVOIDED_MODULES, avoided_flags)):
	New vars, to simplify processing of avoided modules.
	(GNULIB_TOOL_FLAGS): Move --avoid flags into AVOIDED_MODULES.
	Add --gnu-make, and change makefile name to gnulib.mk.in.
	Copy config.guess, config.sub, and install-sh too, since
	Automake no longer does that for us.
	* admin/notes/copyright:
	* admin/update_autogen (genfiles):
	Update list of files.
	Remove hack for nt/gnulib.mk, a file that is no longer needed.
	* autogen.sh (progs): Remove Automake.
	(automake_min): Remove.
	Build aclocal.m4 so that autoreconf need not use aclocal.
	* build-aux/config.guess, build-aux/config.sub:
	* build-aux/install-sh:
	New files, copied from Gnulib.  These are now updated by
	admin/merge-gnulib instead by autogen.sh.
	* configure.ac (AC_PROG_MAKE_SET, ACLOCAL_PATH, AM_CONDITIONAL):
	Remove.
	(AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, AM_SILENT_RULES): Remove call.
	(AC_PROG_CC_C_O): Call this instead of AM_PROG_CC_C_O.
	(BUILDING_FOR_WINDOWSNT, HYBRID_MALLOC_LIB): Remove; no longer needed.
	(--disable-silent-rules): New option, since Automake no longer
	does this for us.
	(AM_V, AM_DEFAULT_V): Set unconditionally, and do not bother
	with AM_SUBST_NOTMAKE.
	(AC_PROG_INSTALL): Add call.
	(MAKEINFO): Do not bother with the 'missing' program.
	(MAKEINFO, SYSTEM_TYPE): AC_SUBST.
	(AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add Makefile, lib/gnulib.mk.
	(SUBDIR_MAKEFILES): Remove duplication.
	* lib/Makefile.am: Remove, replacing with:
	* lib/Makefile.in: New file, with the old Makefile.am contents
	and with the following changes:
	(AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS, BUILT_SOURCES, CLEANFILES, EXTRA_DIST)
	(MOSTLYCLEANDIRS, MOSTLYCLEANFILES, noinst_LIBRARIES, SUFFIXES)
	(AM_CFLAGS, DEFAULT_INCLUDES, libegnu_a_SOURCES, libegnu_a_LIBADD)
	(EXTRA_libegnu_a_SOURCES, libegnu_a_SHORTNAME, libegnu_a_CPPFLAGS):
	Remove.
	(VPATH, abs_top_builddir, top_builddir, top_srcdir, all, AM_V_AR)
	(AM_V_CC, AM_V_GEN, AM_V_at, DEPDIR, DEPFLAGS, MKDEPDIR, SYSTEM_TYPE)
	(libgnu.a, libegnu.a, ETAGS, $(ETAGS), tags, TAGS, clean)
	(mostlyclean, distclean, bootstrap-clean, maintainer-clean):
	New macros and rules, since Automake no longer does them.
	Include ../nt/gnulib-cfg.mk if SYSTEM_TYPE is windows-nt,
	instead of including ../nt/gnulib.mk if BUILDING_FOR_WINDOWS_NT.
	Include dependency files if AUTO_DEPEND.
	(ALL_CFLAGS, AUTOCONF_INPUTS, libgnu_a_OBJECTS, libegnu_a_OBJECTS):
	New macros.
	(bootstrap-clean): Depend on distclean, not maintainer-clean,
	and remove gnulib.mk.
	(AUTOCONF_INPUTS, $(top_srcdir)/configure, ../config.status, Makefile):
	New macros and rules, copied from ../Makefile.in.
	($(libegnu_a_OBJECTS), $(libgnu_a_OBJECTS)): Depend on BUILT_SOURCES.
	(.c.o, e-%.o): New generic rules.
	* lib/gnulib.mk: Remove.
	* lib/gnulib.mk.in: New file, which is built by autogen.sh
	and contains much of what used to be in lib/gnulib.mk.
	* m4/gnulib-common.m4: Copy from gnulib.
	* make-dist: Do not distribute build-aux/compile, build-aux/depcomp,
	build-aux/missing, build-aux/ar-lib, lib/Makefile.am, nt/gnulib.mk,
	nt/gnulib-modules-to-delete.cfg.  Distribute lib/Makefile.in,
	lib/gnulib.mk.in, and nt/gnulib-cfg.mk instead.
	* nt/Makefile.in (AM_V_GEN, am__v_GEN_, am__v_GEN_0)
	(am__v_GEN_1, ${srcdir}/gnulib.mk): Remove.
	* nt/gnulib-cfg.mk: New file, which supersedes ...
	* nt/gnulib-modules-to-delete.cfg: ... this file, which is removed.
	* src/Makefile.in (ACLOCAL_INPUTS): Remove.
	(AUTOCONF_INPUTS): Merge ACLOCAL_INPUTS into it.
	($(top_srcdir)/configure, ../config.status, config.in Makefile):
	Defer to parent Makefile.

	Simplify checks for xdg-open and xdg-email

	browse-url's xdg-open detection was too picky on some GNU/Linux
	desktops; see Bug#25778.  Simplify the code by assuming xdg-open works
	if it is executable, as nowadays this is more likely to be correct than
	trying to use heuristics from a few years ago.  Don't test for nohup: it
	is ineffective nowadays, as xdg-open's child uses the default action for
	SIGHUP even if xdg-open's invoker ignores SIGHUP.  While we're at it,
	allow for Wayland here, as "emacs -nw" might be running in a non-X
	Wayland terminal.
	* lisp/mail/emacsbug.el (report-emacs-bug-can-use-xdg-email):
	* lisp/net/browse-url.el (browse-url-can-use-xdg-open):

	as the rounding error can cause the answer to be off by 1.
	* src/lisp.h (EMACS_UINT_WIDTH): New constant.
	* test/src/floatfns-tests.el (logb-extreme-fixnum): New test.

	This incorporates:
	2017-02-25 maintainer-makefile: Fix AC_PROG_SED with autoconf cache.
	2017-02-24 ftoastr: port to -Wdouble-promotion

2017-03-03  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Avoid duplicating characters recorded in macros

	* src/keyboard.c (record_char): Don't store in macro definitions
	characters that came from executing a macro.  (Bug#25860)

2017-03-03  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* lisp/color.el (color-name-to-rgb): Use 16 bits per color component.
	(color-rgb-to-hex): Accept an optional argument
	DIGITS-PER-COMPONENT, defaulting to 4, and format the hexadecimal
	notation either for 8 or 16 bits per component.  (Bug#25890)
	* lisp/net/shr-color.el (shr-color->hexadecimal): Call
	color-rgb-to-hex with the optional argument of 2, to match color
	processing on the Web.

2017-03-03  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Use lexical binding in benchmark.el

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/benchmark.el: Enable lexical binding.
	(benchmark-elapse): Use 'declare'.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/benchmark-tests.el: Add test suite.

2017-03-03  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Switch pp.el to lexical binding

	Additionally, do some minor code cleanup.

	sql-mode w/ sqlite: In-memory database

	Enable the usage of an in-memory database. Prior to this, sql-mode w/
	sqlite could only be used with file databases.
	* list/progmodes/sql.el (sql-get-login-ext): Don't expand an empty
	file name provided by the user, but call sub-process sqlite with that,
	in which case it uses an in-memory database.

2017-03-03  Allen Li  <vianchielfaura@gmail.com>

	Stop abbrev-prefix-mark from adding extra newline (Bug#25767)

	`abbrev--before-point' does not adjust `pos' to account for when it
	deletes the "-" left by abbrev-prefix-mark.  Therefore, when
	`abbrev-before-point' goes to restore point, it moves point one
	character too far forward.

	* lisp/abbrev.el (abbrev--before-point): Adjust pos when deleting "-".

2017-03-03  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

2017-03-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Restore XFLOATINT but with restricted args

	Turn instances of extract_float into XFLOAT_DATA when possible,
	and to a resurrected XFLOATINT when the arg is a number.
	The resurrected XFLOATINT is more like XFLOAT and XINT in
	that is valid only if its arg is a number.  This clarifies
	the ways in which floats can be extracted at the C level.
	* src/editfns.c (styled_format):
	* src/floatfns.c (extract_float, Fexpt):
	Use XFLOATINT rather than open-coding it.
	* src/fns.c (internal_equal):
	* src/image.c (imagemagick_load_image):
	* src/xdisp.c (resize_mini_window):
	Prefer XFLOAT_DATA to extract_float on values known to be floats.
	* src/frame.c (x_set_screen_gamma):
	* src/frame.h (NUMVAL):
	* src/image.c (x_edge_detection, compute_image_size):
	* src/lread.c (read_filtered_event):
	* src/window.c (Fset_window_vscroll):
	* src/xdisp.c (handle_single_display_spec, try_scrolling)
	(redisplay_window, calc_pixel_width_or_height, x_produce_glyphs)
	(on_hot_spot_p):
	Prefer XFLOATINT to extract_float on values known to be numbers.
	* src/lisp.h (XFLOATINT): Bring back this function, except
	it now assumes its argument is a number.

2017-03-02  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Ert commands to error if no test at point (bug#25931)

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/ert.el (ert-results-mode-menu):
	Deactivate some items if no test at point.
	(ert--results-test-at-point-no-redefinition):
	Add option to signal an error rather than return nil.
	(ert-results-pop-to-backtrace-for-test-at-point)
	(ert-results-pop-to-messages-for-test-at-point)
	(ert-results-pop-to-should-forms-for-test-at-point)
	(ert-results-describe-test-at-point): Error if no test at point.

2017-03-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove XFLOATINT

	* src/lisp.h (XFLOATINT): Remove this alias for extract_float.
	All callers changed to use extract_float.
	* src/frame.h (NUMVAL): Now an inline function, not a macro.

2017-03-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix rounding errors in <, =, etc.

	* etc/NEWS: Document this.
	* src/bytecode.c (exec_byte_code):
	* src/data.c (arithcompare):
	Do not lose information when comparing floats to integers.
	* test/src/data-tests.el (data-tests-=, data-tests-<)
	(data-tests->, data-tests-<=, data-tests->=):
	Test this.

2017-03-02  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix display of mouse-highlight produced by overlapping overlays

	* src/xfaces.c (face_at_buffer_position): If called to find the
	mouse-face, only consider the highest-priority source for that
	face, and ignore the rest.  Previously, all the mouse-face
	definitions at POS were merged in that case.
	* src/xdisp.c (note_mouse_highlight): Record the overlay that
	specifies mouse-face _after_ clearing the info about the previous
	overlay, so as not to clear the information about the just-recorded
	overlay.  (Bug#25906)

2017-03-02  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix display of strike-through text in variable-height lines

	* src/nsterm.m (ns_draw_text_decoration):
	* src/xterm.c (x_draw_glyph_string):
	* src/w32term.c (x_draw_glyph_string): Fix calculation of the
	strike-through y-coordinate for a glyph row which is taller than
	the strike-through text.  (Bug#25907)

2017-03-02  Martin Rudalics  <rudalics@gmx.at>

	Don't call x_net_wm_state for scroll bar windows (Bug#24963, Bug#25887)

	* src/xterm.c (handle_one_xevent): For ConfigureNotify events
	don't call x_net_wm_state when the window is a scroll bar window.
	(Bug#24963, Bug#25887)

2017-03-02  Katsumi Yamaoka  <yamaoka@jpl.org>

	gnus-summary-select-article-buffer: Don't re-render existing article

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-sum.el (gnus-summary-select-article-buffer):
	Don't re-render existing article.

2017-03-02  Katsumi Yamaoka  <yamaoka@jpl.org>

	Don't add debbugs address to message body (bug#25896)

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-group.el (gnus-read-ephemeral-bug-group):
	Don't add debbugs address to message body (bug#25896), and
	don't add it to message header either if it already exists.

2017-03-02  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/cedet/semantic/db-global.el: Make dynbind use explicit

	(semanticdb--ih): Declare.
	(semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases): Use it instead of `ih'.
	(semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-in-buffer, semanticdb-get-database-tables)
	(semanticdb-find-tags-for-completion-method): Silence compiler warning.

2017-03-02  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/help-fns.el (describe-variable): Use cl-print for the value

	Use `pp-buffer' rather than `pp' so as to avoid calling prin1 twice.

2017-03-02  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* test/lisp/net/puny.el: New file.

2017-03-02  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Small puny.el fix

	* lisp/net/puny.el (puny-decode-string-internal):
	Handle strings with no ascii parts.  (Bug#23688)

2017-03-02  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Small recover-this-file improvement

	* lisp/files.el (recover-this-file): Explicit error if not
	visiting a file.  (Bug#23671)

2017-03-01  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Fix for coding-system completion (bug#23670)

	* lisp/international/mule.el (read-buffer-file-coding-system):
	Ensure that completion-pcm--delim-wild-regex is enclosed in parens,
	so that completion-pcm--pattern->regex can append "*?".

2017-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix rounding error in ‘ceiling’ etc.

	Without this fix, (ceiling most-negative-fixnum -1.0) returns
	most-negative-fixnum instead of correctly signaling range-error,
	and similarly for floor, round, and truncate.
	* configure.ac (trunc): Add a check, since Gnulib’s doc says
	‘trunc’ is missing from MSVC 9.  The Gnulib doc says ‘trunc’ is
	also missing from some other older operating systems like Solaris
	9 which I know we don’t care about any more, so MSVC is the only
	reason to worry about ‘trunc’ here.
	* src/editfns.c (styled_format): Formatting a float with %c is now an
	error.  The old code did not work in general, because FIXNUM_OVERFLOW_P
	had rounding errors.  Besides, the "if (FLOATP (...))" was in there
	only as a result of my misunderstanding old code that I introduced
	2011.  Although %d etc. is sometimes used on floats that represent
	huge UIDs or PIDs etc. that do not fit in fixnums, this cannot
	happen with characters.
	* src/floatfns.c (rounding_driver): Rework to do the right thing
	when the intermediate result equals 2.305843009213694e+18, i.e.,
	is exactly 1 greater than MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM on a 64-bit host.
	Simplify so that only one section of code checks for overflow,
	rather than two.
	(double_identity): Remove.  All uses changed to ...
	(emacs_trunc): ... this new function.  Add replacement for
	platforms that lack ‘trunc’.
	* src/lisp.h (FIXNUM_OVERFLOW_P, make_fixnum_or_float):
	Make it clear that the arg cannot be floating point.
	* test/src/editfns-tests.el (format-c-float): New test.
	* test/src/floatfns-tests.el: New file, to test for this bug.

2017-03-01  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Small help--loaded-p fix

	* lisp/help-fns.el (help--loaded-p): Handle entry in load-history
	with nil file name.  (Bug#25847)

2017-03-01  Leo Liu  <sdl.web@gmail.com>

	* src/fns.c (Fbuffer_hash): Doc fix.

2017-03-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't use mapconcat with chars in gnus registry marks (Bug#25839)

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-registry.el (gnus-registry-article-marks-to-chars):
	Instead, use a plain concat, which will create a string out of a list
	of characters.

2017-03-01  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix epg-tests with dummy-pinentry program (Bug#23619)

	* test/data/epg/dummy-pinentry: New file.
	* test/lisp/epg-tests.el (with-epg-tests): Add it to gpg-agent.conf
	when a passphrase is required.  Add debug declaration.  Set
	GPG_AGENT_INFO non-destructively.

2017-02-28  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@russet.org.uk>

	Speed generation of ldefs-boot-auto

	Previously, generation of ldefs-boot-auto required at least one full
	bootstrap and, in extreme cases, two. Now, from build system, it
	requires the same time as taken to dump Emacs.

	* Makefile.in: Remove all calls, pass to src.
	* admin/ldefs-clean.el: Update for changed messages.
	* lisp/Makefile.in (compile-first-delete): Add.
	* lisp/ldefs-boot-auto.el: Update.
	* src/Makefile.in (generate-ldefs-boot): Add.

2017-02-28  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@russet.org.uk>

	Add error handling to magic-mode-alist

	* lisp/files.el (set-auto-mode): Add explicit error handling in two
	  places.

2017-02-28  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@russet.org.uk>

	Remove conditional includes from bootstrap

	Previously, bootstrap-emacs includes optional functionality, depending
	on the platform which is not needed for bootstrap function.  As a
	result, bootstrap-emacs contains different functions in different
	circumstances.  If ldefs-boot-auto.el is generated, then loaded
	functions will not be added to ldefs-boot-auto.el, although they may be
	required during some builds.  With this change, bootstrap-emacs should
	always behave the same way and, therefore, require the same autoloads.

	 * lisp/loadup.el: No longer load optional includes during bootstrap
	   dumping.
	 * lisp/ldefs-boot-auto.el: Regenerate.
	 * lisp/ldefs-boot-manual.el: Add two autoloads.

2017-02-28  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@russet.org.uk>

	Do not use find-file non-interactively

	 * lisp/international/titdic-cnv (miscdic-convert): Use
	   insert-file-contents in place of find-file.

2017-02-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* src/xdisp.c (overlay_arrows_changed_p): Fix return value and doc

	(update_overlay_arrows): Skip non-markers.

2017-02-28  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	Try to avoid hang when logging out of MS-Windows

	* src/w32term.c (x_update_window_begin, x_update_window_end)
	(my_show_window, my_set_window_pos, my_set_focus)
	(my_set_foreground_window, my_destroy_window)
	(my_bring_window_to_top, x_iconify_frame): Replace calls to
	SendMessage by calls to SendMessageTimeout with a 6-second
	timeout.  (Bug#25875)

2017-02-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/textmodes/reftex-toc.el (reftex-re-enlarge): Demote errors.

2017-02-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* doc/misc/eieio.texi: Update to account for the cl-generic facilities

	(Quick Start, Class Options, Generics): Adjust names for cl-generic.
	(Methods): Document cl-defmethod.
	Explain in more detail the order in which the various
	methods are executed.  Document the conditions under which a method
	is redefined.  Remove reference to `eieio-generic-call-arglst`.
	Don't document the precise return value of cl-next-method-p.
	(Static Methods): Adjust to use `subclass` specializer.
	(Method Invocation): Use cl-call-next-method and drop mention of :primary.
	(Signal Handling, Signals): Adjust names and args for cl-generic; add
	cl-no-primary-method.
	(CLOS compatibility, Wish List): Adjust to new featureset.

2017-02-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/cedet/mode-local.el (define-mode-local-override): Declare doctring.

2017-02-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/textmodes/sgml-mode.el: syntax-propertize <![CDATA and <?..?>

	(sgml-syntax-propertize-function): Mark <![CDATA and <?..?>.
	(sgml-syntax-propertize-inside): New fun.

2017-02-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	before adding it to the list of files.

2017-02-27  Juri Linkov  <juri@linkov.net>

	Put text properties on query-replace separator string instead of "\0"

	* lisp/replace.el (query-replace--split-string):
	Split at a substring instead of just character.
	(query-replace-read-from): Put text properties on the
	separator string instead of "\0".  (Bug#25482)

2017-02-27  Juri Linkov  <juri@linkov.net>

	Add file name and its extension to suggestions in dired-mark-files-regexp

	* lisp/dired.el (dired-mark-files-regexp): Add file name

2017-02-27  Chunyang Xu  <mail@xuchunyang.me>  (tiny change)

	Prompt default extension in dired-mark-extension

	* lisp/dired-x.el (dired-mark-extension): Prompt default extension

2017-02-27  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Prevent for consing in cl-mapc and cl-mapl

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-extra.el (cl--mapcar-many): Add optional arg ACC;
	If non-nil, accumulate values in the result (Bug#25826).
	(cl-mapc): Do computations inside function instead of call cl-map.
	(cl-mapl): Do computations inside function instead of call cl-maplist.
	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-lib.el (mapcar): Add autoload cookie.
	Call cl--mapcar-many with non-nil 3rd argument.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-extra-tests.el (cl-extra-test-map)
	(cl-extra-test-mapc, cl-extra-test-mapcar, cl-extra-test-mapl)
	(cl-extra-test-maplist): New tests.

2017-02-27  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Choose the right target dir on dired operations

	Prevent from changing the input target dir
	when dired-dwim-target is non-nil (Bug#25609).
	* lisp/dired-aux.el (dired-do-create-files):
	If dired-dwim-target is non-nil, then bind 'default' to nil.
	* test/lisp/dired-tests.el (dired-test-bug25609): Add test.

2017-02-27  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* src/xdisp.c (overlay_arrows_changed_p): Fix last change.

2017-02-27  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't record eshell/clear "command" in history (Bug#25838)

	`eshell/clear' is implemented by sending a series of blank lines,
	which is not a useful thing to have in the history.

	* lisp/eshell/em-hist.el (eshell-input-filter-default): Use
	`string-blank-p' which does check for newlines (even though newlines
	have comment-end syntax, not whitespace syntax class).
	* lisp/eshell/esh-mode.el (eshell/clear): Remove
	`eshell-add-to-history' from `eshell-input-filter-functions' while
	sending the blank lines.  This change is needed to solve the bug if
	the user customizes `eshell-input-filter' to something that doesn't
	filter newlines.

2017-02-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove a few unused C functions

	* src/eval.c (let_shadows_global_binding_p):

	to avoid a segfault.

2017-02-26  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't call package--ensure-init-file if initialized during startup

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el (package-initialize): Check
	`after-init-time' rather than `load-file-name' to decide if
	`package--ensure-init-file' should be called.  Depending on
	`load-file-name' will fail if the user calls `pacakge-initialize' in
	file which is loaded from the init file (Bug#24643, Bug#25819).

2017-02-26  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix display of before- and after-strings at invisible text

	* src/xdisp.c (next_overlay_string): Don't raise the

	set to continue at a buffer position different from the one
	where the overlay strings we just processed were loaded.  (Bug#25856)

2017-02-26  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Work on `tramp-completion-mode-p'

	* etc/NEWS: Say that `tramp-completion-mode' is obsolete.

	Fix build failure caused by ‘Generate upcase and downcase tables from Unicode’

	The [5ec3a584: Generate upcase and downcase tables from Unicode data]
	commit broke bootstrap from a truly clean tree (e.g. a fresh clone or
	one created with ‘make extraclean’), see
	<http://hydra.nixos.org/build/48774928>.

	The failure was caused by characters.el trying to read Unicode
	property tables which aren’t available so early in the build process.

	Wrap the part that requires Unicode property tables in a condition
	checking if those are available.  If they aren’t they case and syntax
	tables won’t be fully set but later on, the characters.el file will be
	evaluated again and this time with Unicode properties available so
	final Emacs ends up with the exact same case and syntax tables.

	casing: don’t assume letters are *either* upper- or lower-case  (bug#24603)

	A compatibility digraph characters, such as ǅ, are neither upper- nor
	lower-case.  At the moment however, those are reported as upper-case¹
	despite the fact that they change when upper-cased.

	Stop checking if a character is upper-case before trying to up-case it
	so that title-case characters are handled correctly.  This fixes one of
	the issues mentioned in bug#24603.

	¹ Because they change when converted to lower-case.  Notice an asymmetry
	  in that for a character to be considered lower-case it must not be
	  upper-case (plus the usual condition of changing when upper-cased).

	* src/buffer.h (upcase1): Delete.
	(upcase): Change to upcase character unconditionally just like downcase
	does it.  This is what upcase1 was.

	* src/casefiddle.c (casify_object, casify_region): Use upcase instead
	of upcase1 and don’t check !uppercasep(x) before calling upcase.

	* src/keyboard.c (read_key_sequence): Don’t check if uppercase(x), just
	downcase(x) and see if it changed.

	* test/src/casefiddle-tests.el (casefiddle-tests--characters,

	Generate upcase and downcase tables from Unicode data  (bug#24603)

	Use Unicode data to generate case tables instead of mostly repeating

	digraph to ‘dz’ when down- and ‘DZ’ when upcasing.

	https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?msg=89;bug=24603 lists all

	* lisp/international/characters.el: Remove case-pairs defined with

	* Makefile.in (${srcdir}/info/dir): When making this file, do not
	do anything special about its timestamp.  Previously this rule
	used move-if-change, which meant that this file’s timestamp could
	end up being older than the files it depends on, and this caused
	‘make --question info’ to fail, which caused ‘make-dist’ to fail
	now that ‘make-dist’ invokes ‘make --question info’.

2017-02-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Make FOR_EACH_TAIL more like other FOR_EACH macros

	See comments by Stefan Monnier in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-02/msg00181.html
	and by Eli Zaretskii in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-02/msg00207.html
	* src/fns.c (internal_equal): Do not bypass check for depth
	overflow when tail-recursing via a dotted list tail or an overlay
	plist, to avoid a rare infloop.
	* src/lisp.h (FOR_EACH_TAIL, FOR_EACH_TAIL_SAFE): Take TAIL as an
	arg, and update it at each iteration, rather than have callers
	access it.tail.  All callers changed.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL): Do not check for dotted lists, as this is now
	the caller’s responsibility.  All callers changed.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL_CONS): Remove.  All callers changed.
	(struct for_each_tail_internal.tail): Remove; no longer needed.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL_INTERNAL): Remove dotted arg, and set the tail
	arg each time through the loop.  All callers changed.

2017-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port to clang 3.8.0

	It does not allow a for-loop's control var to be an anonymous struct.
	* src/lisp.h (struct for_each_tail_internal): New type.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL_INTERNAL): Use it.

2017-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@Penguin.CS.UCLA.EDU>

	Add cyclic-list tests

	* test/manual/cycle-tests.el: New file (Bug#25606).

2017-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@Penguin.CS.UCLA.EDU>

	FOR_EACH_TAIL now checks for quit

	As per Eli Zaretskii (Bug#25606#20).  Although these calls to
	maybe_quit are unnecessary in practice, Eli was not convinced
	that the calls are unnecessary.
	* src/lisp.h (FOR_EACH_TAIL, FOR_EACH_TAIL_CONS):
	Call maybe_quit every so often.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL_INTERNAL): New arg CHECK_QUIT.  All callers changed.

2017-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Signal list cycles in ‘length’ etc.

	Use macros like FOR_EACH_TAIL instead of maybe_quit to
	catch list cycles automatically instead of relying on the
	user becoming impatient and typing C-g (Bug#25606).
	* src/fns.c (Flength, Fmember, Fmemq, Fmemql, Fassq, Fassoc, Frassq)
	(Frassoc, Fdelete, Freverse):
	Use FOR_EACH_TAIL instead of maybe_quit.
	(Fnreverse): Use simple EQ to check for circular list instead
	of rarely_quit, as this suffices in this unusual case.
	(Fplist_put, Flax_plist_put, Flax_plist_put):
	Use FOR_EACH_TAIL_CONS instead of maybe_quit.
	(internal_equal): Use FOR_EACH_TAIL_CONS to check lists, instead
	of by-hand tail recursion that did not catch cycles.
	* src/fns.c (Fsafe_length, Fplist_get):
	* src/xdisp.c (display_mode_element):
	Use FOR_EACH_TAIL_SAFE instead of by-hand Floyd’s algorithm.
	* src/lisp.h (QUIT_COUNT_HEURISTIC): Remove; no longer needed.
	(rarely_quit): Simply count toward USHRT_MAX + 1, since the
	fancier versions are no longer needed.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL_CONS, FOR_EACH_TAIL_SAFE)
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL_INTERNAL): New macros, the last with definiens
	mostly taken from FOR_EACH_TAIL.
	(FOR_EACH_TAIL): Rewrite in terms of FOR_EACH_TAIL_INTERNAL.

2017-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify use of FOR_EACH_TAIL

	* src/data.c (circular_list): New function.
	* src/lisp.h (FOR_EACH_TAIL): Use Brent’s algorithm and C99 for-loop
	decl, to eliminate the need for the args TAIL, TORTOISE and N, and
	to speed things up a bit on typical hosts with optimization.
	All uses changed (Bug#25605).

2017-02-05  Simen Heggestøyl  <simenheg@gmail.com>

	* lisp/textmodes/css-mode.el: Require subr-x at compile time

2017-02-05  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Clarify documentation of 'bufferpos-to-filepos' and 'filepos-to-bufferpos'

	* doc/lispref/nonascii.texi (Text Representations): Clarify that
	'exact' value of QUALITY argument to 'bufferpos-to-filepos' and
	'filepos-to-bufferpos' can lead to expensive and slow processing.

	* lisp/international/mule-util.el (filepos-to-bufferpos)
	(bufferpos-to-filepos): Doc fix.  (Bug#25626)

2017-02-05  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into feature/byte-switch

2017-02-05  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	bytecomp.el: Use macroexp-const-p instead of bc-cond-valid-obj2-p.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-cond-vars): Use
	  (macroexp-cons-p) instead of (byte-compile-cond-valid-obj2-p) to
	  make sure that obj1/obj2 can be compared with `eq'.

2017-02-05  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	* byte-opt.el (byte-decompile-bytecode-1): Use eq instead of =.

2017-02-05  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	  in a jump table, or default/done tags.
	  Set the depth of final tags for byte-switch to nil after emitting
	  any jumps to them.

2017-02-05  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	byte-opt.el: Replace jump tables while decompiling correctly.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/byte-opt.el (byte-decompile-bytecode-1):
	  Don't make a copy of the constant vector, as it isn't used with
	  the decompiled lapcode.
	  Make sure that the correct lapcode pair/list is being modified while
	  replacing the jump table.

2017-02-05  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	bytecomp.el: Don't store non-keyword symbols in jump-tables.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile-cond-valid-obj2-p) return
	  nil when OBJ is a non-keyword symbol (i.e a variable), as the jump
	  table can only be used when comparing variables with constant values.

2017-02-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Re-port alloc.c to Solaris sparc and simplify

	alloc.c had bitrotted a bit, and used an undefined symbol
	stack_base when Emacs was built on Solaris sparc, leading to
	compilation failures.  Also, code related to __builtin_unwind_init
	was unnecessarily duplicated.  Fix the bitrot and remove some
	duplication.
	* src/alloc.c: Remove uses of GC_SAVE_REGISTERS_ON_STACK, since it
	is never defined.
	(test_setjmp) [!HAVE___BUILTIN_UNWIND_INIT && GC_SETJMP_WORKS]:
	Define a no-op dummy, to simplify use.
	(test_setjmp) [!GC_SETJMP_WORKS]: Test setjmp_tested_p here rather
	than in the caller, to simplify use.
	(stacktop_sentry): New type.
	(__builtin_unwind_init) [!HAVE___BUILTIN_UNWIND_INIT]: New macro.
	(SET_STACK_TOP_ADDRESS): New macro, containing code that was duplicated.
	(flush_stack_call_func, Fgarbage_collect): Use it.
	(init_alloc): Omit unnecessary initialization.
	After dumping, Emacs need not re-test setjmp.

2017-02-03  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	* test/manual/scroll-tests.el: New tests for scroll-margin behavior.

2017-02-03  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix scrolling with partial lines

	* src/xdisp.c (partial_line_height): New function.

	* doc/emacs/display.texi (Auto Scrolling):
	* doc/lispref/windows.texi (Textual Scrolling): Document it.
	* src/window.c (window_scroll_pixel_based): Use it instead of hardcoding
	division by 4 (Bug #5718).

2017-02-03  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't count mode line for scroll-margin limit

	* src/window.c (window_scroll_margin): Use window_box_height to avoid
	counting header line, scrollbars for scroll-margin limit (Bug #5718).

2017-02-03  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Refactor uses of scroll_margin to a function

	Its effective range needs to be clamped between 0 and (window height /
	4), so it's better to have this constraint in a single place.

	* src/window.c (window_scroll_margin): New function.
	(window_scroll_pixel_based, window_scroll_line_based):
	(Frecenter, Fmove_to_window_line):
	* src/xdisp.c (try_scrolling, try_cursor_movement):
	(redisplay_window, try_window, try_window_id): Use it.

2017-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix lisp.h underparenthesization

	* src/lisp.h (STACK_CONS, AUTO_STRING_WITH_LEN):
	Parenthesize compound literals that are function call args.
	Although this does not fix any bugs, it is the proper style for
	macro parenthesization as it means this code will continue to
	work even if make_lisp_ptr is changed to a macro.

2017-02-02  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/doc-view.el (doc-view-mode): Don't require a final newline

2017-02-02  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Treat list-buffers-directory as a string

	Another step in the long history of list-buffers-directory.  A thread
	branch discussing the meaning/use of the variable starts here
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-09/msg00684.html
	Also see (info "(elisp) Buffer File Name").
	* lisp/buff-menu.el: Relocate special case code into info.el.  Nix
	Info-* defvars.
	(Buffer-menu--pretty-file-name): Remove special case.  Use

	bindings.

2017-02-02  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Prevent creating thumbnails of all gif frames

	With the previous defaults, doing image-dired on a directory with an
	animated foo.gif would cause creation of foo.thumb-N.gif for each of
	N frames in foo.gif.  By default image-dired looks for foo.thumb.gif, so
	there additionally is no usable thumbnail after all the needless effort.
	image-dired never handled animation, regardless.
	* lisp/image-dired.el: Mention limitation.
	(image-dired-cmd-create-thumbnail-options):
	(image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-options):
	(image-dired-cmd-create-standard-thumbnail-options): Append [0] to
	filename to indicate only converting the 0th frame.
	(image-dired-display-image-mode): Don't show a cursor.

2017-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix quitting bug when buffers are frozen

	Problem noted by Eli Zaretskii in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-01/msg00721.html
	This patch also fixes some other issues in that report.
	* src/lisp.h (incr_rarely_quit): Remove.
	All callers changed to use rarely_quit directly.
	* src/search.c (freeze_buffer_relocation)
	(thaw_buffer_relocation): New functions.
	(looking_at_1, fast_looking_at, search_buffer):
	Use them to fix bug when quitting when buffers are frozen.
	* src/sysdep.c (emacs_intr_read): Rename from emacs_nointr_read.
	All uses changed.

2017-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Revamp quitting and fix infloops

	This fixes some infinite loops that cannot be quitted out of,
	e.g., (defun foo () (nth most-positive-fixnum '#1=(1 . #1#)))
	when byte-compiled and when run under X.  See:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-01/msg00577.html
	This also attempts to keep the performance improvements I recently
	added, as much as possible under the constraint that the infloops
	must be caught.  In some cases this fixes infloop bugs recently
	introduced when I removed immediate_quit.
	* src/alloc.c (Fmake_list):
	Use rarely_quit, not maybe_quit, for speed in the usual case.
	* src/bytecode.c (exec_byte_code):
	* src/editfns.c (Fcompare_buffer_substrings):
	* src/fns.c (Fnthcdr):
	* src/syntax.c (scan_words, skip_chars, skip_syntaxes)
	(Fbackward_prefix_chars):
	Use rarely_quit so that users can C-g out of long loops.
	* src/callproc.c (call_process_cleanup, call_process):
	* src/fileio.c (read_non_regular, Finsert_file_contents):
	* src/indent.c (compute_motion):
	* src/syntax.c (scan_words, Fforward_comment):
	Remove now-unnecessary maybe_quit calls.
	* src/callproc.c (call_process):
	* src/doc.c (get_doc_string, Fsnarf_documentation):
	* src/fileio.c (Fcopy_file, read_non_regular, Finsert_file_contents):
	* src/lread.c (safe_to_load_version):
	* src/sysdep.c (system_process_attributes) [GNU_LINUX]:

	Use emacs_write_quit instead of emacs_write_sig in places where
	C-g handling is safe.
	* src/filelock.c (create_lock_file): Use emacs_write, not
	plain write, as emacs_write no longer has a problem.

	inner loop, so that it catches C-g there too.

	Remove immediate_quit.

	The old code that sets and clears immediate_quit was
	ineffective except when Emacs is running in terminal mode, and
	has problematic race conditions anyway, so remove it.  This
	will introduce some hangs when Emacs runs in terminal mode,
	and these hangs should be fixed in followup patches.
	* src/keyboard.c (immediate_quit): Remove.  All uses removed.

2017-02-01  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Allow C++ nested brace-list-entries to be better indented.

	This fixes bug #24431.  The key change of this bug fix is correctly analyzing
	nested brace lists when the opening element stands on the same line as both
	its introductory brace and an enclosing parameter list parenthesis.

	* list/progmodes/cc-align.el (c-lineup-under-anchor): New line-up function.

	* list/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist): Accept the
	presence of exactly an identifier between an open parenthesis and an open
	brace as evidence of the brace starting a brace list.
	(c-looking-at-statement-block): New function, extracted from
	c-looking-at-inexpr-block.  Enhance it to analyze inner blocks recursively
	when needed.
	(c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Extract new function (see above) and call it.
	(c-add-stmt-syntax): Enhance, with new &optional parameter, to supply the
	prime syntactic symbol with a fixed anchor point.  When this is used, restrict
	all added syntactic symbols to those having an anchor point on the same line.
	Add, in addition to the current additional symbols, c-brace-list-entry when
	needed; use c-looking-at-statement-block to determine the latter.
	(c-guess-basic-syntax, CASE 9D): Use c-add-stmt-syntax rather than just
	c-add-syntax, to assemble the syntactic context of a 'brace-list-entry, thus
	getting, possibly, several accompanying syntactic entries.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-styles.el (c-style-alist, "gnu" style): New entry for
	'brace-list-intro, namely c-lineup-arglist-intro-after-paren.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-vars.el (c-offsets-alist): Change the factory default
	offset for 'brace-list-entry from 0 to c-lineup-under-anchor.

	* doc/misc/cc-mode.texi (Syntactic Symbols): Amend the definition of
	brace-list-intro.
	(Brace List Symbols): Amend the example to show the new analysis of brace
	lists when the first element comes on the same line as the opening brace.
	(Misc Line-Up): Document the new line-up function c-lineup-under-anchor.

	* lisp/gnus/mml.el (mml-generate-mime-1): It seems nonsensical
	to try to determine the charset of non-text message parts, so
	skip that (bug#24190).  This will also remove messages like
	"bunzip2ing /tmp/acsb.cpio.bz2...done" while sending messages
	if you include such files.

2017-01-27  Lars Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

2017-01-26  Lars Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

	Remove dead code from rfc2047

	* lisp/mail/rfc2047.el (rfc2047-fold-field): Remove dead code.

	It's been disabled since 2005, when I made the change with the
	following comment.

	(rfc2047-encode-message-header): Disabled header folding -- not
	all headers can be folded, and this should be done by the message
	composition mode.  Probably.  I think.

2017-01-26  Lars Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

	Fill too long mail headers

	* lisp/gnus/message.el (message--fold-long-headers): New

	(message-send-mail): Use it to fill headers longer than 998
	characters (which is the protocol limit).

2017-01-26  Lars Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

	Make nndoc more resilient against corrupted files

	* lisp/gnus/nndoc.el (nndoc-possibly-change-buffer): Don't bug
	out on invalid files, like invalid .gz files (bug#21538).
	This may hinder Gnus from starting up.

2017-01-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Replace QUIT with maybe_quit

	There’s no longer need to have QUIT stand for a slug of C statements.
	Use the more-obvious function-call syntax instead.
	Also, use true and false when setting immediate_quit.
	These changes should not affect the generated machine code.
	* src/lisp.h (QUIT): Remove.  All uses replaced by maybe_quit.

2017-01-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	A quicker check for quit

	On some microbenchmarks this lets Emacs run 60% faster on my
	platform (AMD Phenom II X4 910e, Fedora 25 x86-64).
	* src/atimer.c: Include keyboard.h, for pending_signals.
	* src/editfns.c (Fcompare_buffer_substrings):
	* src/fns.c (Fnthcdr, Fmemq, Fmemql, Fassq, Frassq, Fplist_put)
	(Fnconc, Fplist_member):
	Set and clear immediate_quit before and after loop instead of
	executing QUIT each time through the loop.  This is OK for loops
	that affect only locals.
	* src/eval.c (process_quit_flag): Now static.
	(maybe_quit): New function, containing QUIT’s old body.
	* src/fns.c (rarely_quit): New function.
	(Fmember, Fassoc, Frassoc, Fdelete, Fnreverse, Freverse)
	(Flax_plist_get, Flax_plist_put, internal_equal, Fnconc):
	Use it instead of QUIT, for
	speed in tight loops that might modify non-locals.
	* src/keyboard.h (pending_signals, process_pending_signals):
	These belong to keyboard.c, so move them here ...
	* src/lisp.h: ... from here.
	(QUIT): Redefine in terms of the new maybe_quit function, which
	contains this macro’s old definiens.  This works well with branch
	prediction on processors with return stack buffers, e.g., x86
	other than the original Pentium.

2017-01-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify make-list implementation

	* src/alloc.c (Fmake_list): Don’t unroll loop, as the complexity

	Make use of cl-loop destructuring

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-art.el (gnus-article-mode-map): Also bind the
	C-c keys so that they execute in the summary buffer

	Don't mark articles in Gnus as displayed when they aren't

	comment starter (Bug#24870).

	* src/syntax.c (in_2char_comment_start): New function, extracted from
	`scan_sexps_forward'.
	(scan_sexps_forward): Add check for a 2-char comment starter before the

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/backquote.el (top-level): Give , and '@ doc strings on the
	function-documentation property.  Also give these symbols a reader-construct
	property.

	* lisp/help-fns.el (describe-function): Allow the function-documentation
	property to work.  Use princ rather than prin1 to print the function's name
	when it has a reader-construct property.

2017-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve uses of CHECK_LIST etc.

	(lambda_arity): Use plain CHECK_CONS.

	(Fcopy_alist): Remove unnecessary CHECK_LIST call, since
	concat does that for us.
	(Fnthcdr, Fmember, Fmemql, Fdelete, Fnreverse):
	Use CHECK_LIST_END, not CHECK_LIST_CONS.  This hoists a
	runtime check out of the loop.
	(Fmemq): Simplify and use CHECK_LIST_END instead of CHECK_LIST.
	(Fassq, Fassoc, Frassq, Frassoc):
	Simplify and use CHECK_LIST_END instead of CAR.

	* src/fontset.c (Fnew_fontset):
	* src/frame.c (Fmodify_frame_parameters):
	Use CHECK_LIST_END at end, rather than CHECK_LIST at start, for a
	more-complete check.

	Fix low-level handling of (big) C macros.

	In particular, ensure that a comment detected by its syntax is not a CPP
	construct marked with generic comment delimiter syntax-table text
	properties.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-macro, c-end-of-macro): Set
	c-macro-cache-syntactic to nil when the cached macro changes.

	Don't wait for frame to become visible

	frame to become visible.  We have to deal with invisible frames anyway,
	the loop could sometimes before the frame turned visible, and for some
	window managers (e.g., XMonad, i3wm) it caused Emacs to get stuck in a
	busy loop (Bug#24091).

	diff-hunk-kill independent of point inside headers

	Make diff-apply-hunk and diff-hunk-kill independent of the point
	position in a diff header (Bug#17544).

	Check that variable lists are actually lists

	'let' and 'let*' document that their first argument has to be a list,

	with all the guts of lisp_mutex_lock.
	(lisp_mutex_lock): Call lisp_mutex_lock_for_thread.
	(condition_wait_callback): Don't call post_acquire_global_lock
	before locking the mutex, as that could cause a signaled thread to
	exit prematurely, because the condvar's mutex is recorded to be
	not owned by any thread, and with-mutex wants to unlock it as part
	of unwinding the stack in response to the signal.

2017-01-14  Vibhav Pant  <vibhavp@gmail.com>

	Add new 'switch' byte-code.

	'switch' takes two arguments from the stack: the variable to test, and
	a jump table (implemented as a hash-table with the appropriate :test
	function). By looking up the value of the variable in the hash table,
	the interpreter can jump to the label pointed to by the value, if any.
	This implementation can only be used for `cond' forms of the type
	`(cond ((test x 'foo) 'bar) ...)`, such that the function `test` and
	variable `x` is same for all clauses.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el:

	  * Add (byte-compile-cond-valid-obj2-p), (byte-compile-cond-vars),
	    (byte-compile-cond-jump-table-info), (byte-compile-jump-table-add-tag),
	    (byte-compile-cond-jump-table), byte-compile-jump-tables.

	  * Add defcustom `byte-compile-cond-use-jump-table'.

	  * (byte-compile-cond): Use them.

	  * (byte-compile-lapcode): Patch tags present in jump tables, if any.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp//byte-opt.el: (byte-optimize-lapcode): Add checks to
	  some peephole optimizations to prevent them from messing up any code
	  involving `byte-switch`.

	* src/bytecode.c: (exec_byte_code): Add bytecode Bswitch.

	loaddefs (rather it is dumped), hence we must record autoloads until the
	full emacs binary is dumped.

	These tests intermittently fail on hydra.nixos.org for unclear
	reasons related to starting the external process.
	This isn't an Emacs issue, and the failures cause noise on
	the emacs-buildstatus list.  (Bug#24503)
	* test/lisp/net/network-stream-tests.el (echo-server-nowait)
	(connect-to-tls-ipv4-nowait): Skip rather than fail if the
	external process fails to start properly.

	Improve definition of 'variable-pitch' face on MS-Windows

	Use expanded stack during regex matches

	While the stack is increased in main(), to allow the regex stack
	allocation to use alloca we also need to modify regex.c to actually take
	advantage of the increased stack, and not limit stack allocations to
	SAFE_ALLOCA bytes.

	* src/regex.c (MATCH_MAY_ALLOCATE): Remove obsolete comment about
	allocations in signal handlers which no longer happens and correct
	description about when and why MATCH_MAY_ALLOCATE should be defined.
	(emacs_re_safe_alloca): New variable.
	(REGEX_USE_SAFE_ALLOCA): Use it as the limit of stack allocation instead
	of MAX_ALLOCA.
	(emacs_re_max_failures): Rename from `re_max_failures' to avoid
	confusion with glibc's `re_max_failures'.
	* src/emacs.c (main): Increase the amount of fixed 'extra' bytes we add
	to the stack.  Instead of changing emacs_re_max_failures based on the
	new stack size, just change emacs_re_safe_alloca; emacs_re_max_failures
	remains constant regardless, since if we run out stack space SAFE_ALLOCA
	will fall back to heap allocation.

2017-01-09  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix computation of regex stack limit

	The regex stack limit was being computed as the number of stack entries,
	whereas it was being compared with the current size as measured in
	bytes.  This could cause indefinite looping when nearing the stack limit
	if re_max_failures happened not to be a multiple of sizeof
	fail_stack_elt_t (Bug #24751).

	* src/regex.c (GROW_FAIL_STACK): Compute both current stack size and
	limit as numbers of stack entries.

2017-01-08  Alan Third  <alan@idiocy.org>

2017-01-05  Johan Claesson  <johanclaesson@bredband.net>  (tiny change)

	Fix term.el handling of ^Z-sequences spanning chunks

	Bash will after each command send ?\032 and the current directory "/tmp"
	to inform term.el.  Bash output is buffered in 4096 bytes chunks.  If a

	end of the ?\032 sequence to use \n instead of $, the latter can match

	Add term/tmux.el

	Since tmux version 2.1, new tmux terminfos are shipped due to oddities
	with xterm and screen terminfos.  This is simply a duplication of
	term/screen.el with screen -> tmux.
	* lisp/term/tmux.el: New file.

2017-01-01  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Fix encoding of JSON surrogate pairs

	JSON requires that such pairs be treated as UTF-16 surrogate pairs, not
	individual code points; cf. Bug #24784.

	* lisp/json.el (json-read-escaped-char): Fix decoding of surrogate
	pairs.
	(json--decode-utf-16-surrogates): New defun.

	* test/lisp/json-tests.el (test-json-read-string): Add test for
	surrogate pairs.

	Give eval-and-compile a correct edebug spec.  Fixes bug #16184 properly.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/edebug.el (edebug_offset_indices): Revert abortive commit
	from Thu Dec 29 09:22:36 2016 +0000 which didn't really fix the bug.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/byte-run.el (eval-and-compile): Change the edebug spec from

2016-12-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Clarify internal_catch etc.

	The recent change to internal_catch and friends relied on some
	confusion I introduced to the code in 2013.  Attempt to fix
	the confusion by clarifying the code instead.  This saves an
	instruction and a load dependency in the typical case.
	* src/eval.c (internal_catch, internal_condition_case)
	(internal_condition_case_1, internal_condition_case_2)
	(internal_condition_case_n): Undo the previous change.  Instead,
	use use ‘c’ rather than ‘handlerlist’ in the typical case.
	Also, use ‘eassert’ rather than ‘clobbered_eassert’ when possible.

2016-12-31  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	Further improve filenotify-tests.el

	* test/lisp/filenotify-tests.el
	(file-notify--test-read-event): Adapt to file monitors of type
	GFamFileMonitor, which occur on Cygwin.
	(file-notify--test-monitor): Update doc string.

2016-12-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2016-12-31  Alan Third  <alan@idiocy.org>

	Rework NS event handling (bug#25265)

	* src/nsterm.m (unwind_apploopnr): Remove.
	(ns_read_socket): Remove references to apploopnr.  Make processing the
	NS event loop conditional on being in the main thread.
	(ns_select): Remove references to apploopnr.  Remove all fd_handler
	related stuff.  Check if there are events waiting on the NS event
	queue rather than running the event loop.  Remove unused variables and
	code.
	(fd_handler): Remove.
	(ns_term_init): Remove creation of fd_handler thread.
	(hold_event, EmacsApp:sendEvent, EmacsView:mouseMoved,
	EmacsView:windowDidExpose): Remove send_appdefined.
	(ns_send_appdefined): Always check the event queue for

	* src/nsterm.h: Remove reference to fd_handler method.

2016-12-31  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Checkdoc: use syntax functions instead of regex

	In checkdoc.el, get rid of the error-prone regex to find definition
	forms, and use existing syntax-based navigation functions instead.
	This fixes a corner case with one-argument `defvar' forms.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/checkdoc.el (checkdoc--next-docstring): New function.
	(checkdoc-next-docstring, checkdoc-defun): Use it.
	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/checkdoc-tests.el (checkdoc-tests--next-docstring):
	Add unit test.

2016-12-31  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Don't define NOMINMAX on MS-Windows

	* src/callproc.c (NOMINMAX) [WINDOWSNT]: Don't define.  This is no
	longer needed with the current sources and MinGW headers, while
	defining NOMINMAX causes an annoying compiler warning.

2016-12-31  Chris Gregory  <czipperz@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	functions.

	test before the loop.

2016-12-31  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Serialize random number generation on MS-Windows

	* src/w32.c (rand_as183): New function.
	(random): Use it instead of MS runtime's 'rand'.  This avoids
	producing separate and identical random series in each Lisp
	thread.
	(srandom): Modify to supply 3 seed values to 'rand_as183'.

2016-12-31  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* src/gfilenotify.c (Fgfile_monitor_name): Return interned symbol.

2016-12-30  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Don't call xg_select for a NextStep build.

	NextStep builds use glib but don't use xg_select.

	* src/process.c (wait_reading_process_output): Don't call xg_select
	for a NextStep build.

2016-12-30  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Increase the obarray size.

	In a typical GNU/Linux/X11 build, we wind up with over 15k symbols by
	the time we've started.  The old obarray size ensured an average chain
	length of 10 or more.

	* src/lread.c (OBARRAY_SIZE): Increase to 15121.

2016-12-30  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	Initialize thread support for Xlib.

	* src/xterm.c (x_initialize) [THREADS_ENABLED]: Call XInitThreads
	before doing anything else with X.

2016-12-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Rename primary_thread to main_thread

	This avoids the confusion of using two different phrases "main thread"
	and "primary thread" internally to mean the same thing.  See:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-12/msg01142.html
	* src/thread.c (main_thread): Rename from primary_thread,
	since the new name no longer clashes with main_thread_id
	and Emacs internals normally call this the "main thread".
	(init_main_thread): Rename from init_primary_thread.
	(main_thread_p): Rename from primary_thread_p.
	All uses changed.

2016-12-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Rename main_thread to main_thread_id and simplify

	* src/emacs-module.c: Include syssignal.h, for main_thread_id.
	[HAVE_PTHREAD]: Do not include pthread.h.
	(main_thread): Remove.  All uses replaced by main_thread_id,
	or by dwMainThreadId on NT.  Since the HAVE_PTHREAD code is now using
	the main_thread_id established by sysdep.c, there is no need for a
	separate copy of the main thread ID here.
	(module_init): Remove.  All uses removed.
	* src/sysdep.c (main_thread_id) [HAVE_PTHREAD]:
	Rename from main_thread.  All uses changed.  Now extern.

2016-12-30  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* src/gfilenotify.c (Fgfile_monitor_name): Return a symbol.

2016-12-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sysdep.c (deliver_process_signal): Improve comment.

2016-12-30  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	CC Mode: Fix the fontification of a spuriously recognised enum member.

	The "enum" was in an argument list, but triggered the fontification of a
	following identifier in the function block as though it were in an enum
	declaration.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-enum-body): New function.
	(c-basic-matchers-after): Replace the inline stanza for enum elements with a
	call to c-font-lock-enum-body.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-langs.el (c-enum-clause-introduction-re): New language
	variable.

2016-12-30  Nicolas Petton  <nicolas@petton.fr>

2016-12-30  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Attempt to fix crashes with threads in GTK builds

	* src/xgselect.c (xg_select): Call pselect via thread_select, not
	directly, to avoid running Lisp (via unblock_input) when more than
	one thread could be running.  (Bug#25247)
	* src/process.c (wait_reading_process_output) [HAVE_GLIB]: Call
	xg_select directly instead of through thread_select.
	* src/xgselect.h (xg_select): Last 2 arguments are no longer
	'const', for consistency with thread_select.

2016-12-30  Arash Esbati  <arash.esbati@gmail.com>

	Backport: Remove an ambiguity from defvar's doc string.  Fixes bug #25292.

	The ambiguity was whether INITVALUE is evaluated when it's not going to be
	used to set SYMBOL's value.

	* src/eval.c (defvar): Rewrite a paragraph of the doc string.

	(cherry picked from commit 8295e97f18490a535d1188a3daf0b0fd1bf4fa0d)

2016-12-30  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	ffap-string-at-point: Limit max length of active region

	(ffap-string-at-point): Use it.
	* test/lisp/ffap-tests.el: New test suite.
	(ffap-tests-25243): Add test for this bug.

2016-12-29  Mike Kupfer  <mkupfer@alum.berkeley.edu>

	(file-notify-test06-many-events): Improve event list for cygwin.
	(file-notify-test08-watched-file-in-watched-dir): Add cygwin case.

2016-12-29  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Partially correct fontification of "(b*3)", and the like, in C++ Mode

	This problem is caused by the fundamental ambiguity in C++ between
	argument declarations and initialisation clauses.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): If we have an open
	paren preceded by an arithmetic operator, we give this the context nil, not
	'arglist.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-langs.el (c-arithmetic-operators, c-arithmetic-op-regexp):
	New lang consts and vars.

2016-12-29  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Initialize edebug-offset-indices to a cons, not nil.  Fixes bug #16184.

	This is because there are times when this variable is changed by setcar before
	an atom is pushed onto it by debug-enter.  This happens, for example, whilst
	instrumenting c-font-lock-declarations in .../lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/edebug.el (edebug-offset-indices): initialize to '(0).

	Simplify prog1 implementation

	Inspired by a suggestion from Chris Gregory in:

	Reported by Eli Zaretskii (Bug#25128#19).

2016-12-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	regex.h now includes sys/types.h

	* src/dired.c, src/emacs.c, src/search.c, src/syntax.c, src/thread.h:
	Do not include sys/types.h; no longer needed.
	* src/regex.h: Include <sys/types.h>, as that's what Gnulib and
	glibc regex.h does, and POSIX has blessed this since 2008.

2016-12-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Reorder lisp.h to declare types before using them

	This puts basic functions for types to be after the corresponding
	type definitions.  This is a more-common programming style in C,
	and will make it easier to port Emacs to gcc
	-fcheck-pointer-bounds, since the functions now have access to the
	corresponding types' sizes.  This patch does not change the code;
	it just moves declarations and definitions and removes
	no-longer-needed forward declarations (Bug#25128).
	* src/buffer.c, src/data.c, src/image.c:
	Include process.h, for PROCESSP.
	* src/buffer.h (BUFFERP, CHECK_BUFFER, XBUFFER):
	* src/process.h (PROCESSP, CHECK_PROCESS, XPROCESS):
	* src/termhooks.h (TERMINALP, XTERMINAL):
	* src/window.h (WINDOWP, CHECK_WINDOW, XWINDOW):
	* src/thread.h (THREADP, CHECK_THREAD, XTHREAD, MUTEXP, CHECK_MUTEX)
	(XMUTEX, CONDVARP, CHECK_CONDVAR, XCONDVAR):
	Move here from lisp.h.
	* src/intervals.h: Include buffer.h, for BUFFERP.
	Include lisp.h, for Lisp_Object.
	* src/lisp.h: Reorder declarations and definitions as described
	above.  Move thread includes to be later, so that they can use the
	reordered definitions.  Move some symbols to other headers (noted
	elsewhere).  Remove forward decls that are no longer needed.
	* src/thread.h: Include systhread.h here, not in lisp.h,
	since lisp.h itself does not need systhread.h.

	diff-mode auto-refines only after a successful motion

	Prior to this patch (if enabled) auto-refinement would kick in after all
	hunk navigation commands, even if the motion failed.  This would result
	in a situation where the hunk navigation would signal an error and beep,
	but yet still accomplish potentially useful work, by auto-refining.
	This patch moves the auto-refinement code to only run when a motion was
	successful

	* lisp/vc/diff-mode.el (diff--internal-hunk-next,
	  diff--internal-hunk-prev): Removed auto-refinement-triggering code
	* lisp/vc/diff-mode.el (diff--wrap-navigation): Added
	  auto-refinement-triggering code

	diff-mode is able to better handle file headers

	This fixes a regression introduced in

	  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=emacs.git;a=commit;h=2c8a7e50d24daf19ea7d86f1cfeaa98a41c56085

	This bug was filed in

	  https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=25105

	Patches generated from a VCS such as git contain a patch message at the
	start, and diff-mode is now once-again able to properly able to ignore
	this message when issuing navigation commands around the message.

	* lisp/vc/diff-mode.el (diff-beginning-of-file-and-junk): More
	  thoroughly ignore the header when looking for a beginning of file
	  diffs.

	Use completion-at-point in verilog-mode

	There were some functions in verilog-mode that implemented in-buffer

	* loadup.el [ns]: "ucs-normalize" uses `string-to-list' which is defined
	  in "mule-util", so we have to load "mule-util" before "ucs-normalize",
	  otherwise I get "Eager macro-expansion failure" on "make bootstrap"

2016-12-19  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Fix Bug#24980

	* lisp/ido.el (ido-add-virtual-buffers-to-list):
	Suppress Tramp invocation.  (Bug#24980)

2016-12-18  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Add a new compile error regexp for Clang includes

	Clang uses a slight variation of GCC's include format, causing includes
	to be treated as warnings instead of informational messages.  Use a new
	regular expression instead.

	* lisp/progmodes/compile.el
	(compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist): New element
	`clang-include' for Clang-style "included from" lines.
	* test/lisp/progmodes/compile-tests.el
	(compile-tests--test-regexps-data): Add unit test.

2016-12-18  Alan Third  <alan@idiocy.org>

	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/rx-tests.el (rx-char-any): New test.

2016-12-18  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Use floor of mtime instead of rounding for thumb property

	This seems to be the correct thing to do, at least more in line with
	what at least one other implementation does.  Anything using
	gnome-desktop [0] effectively does the same, as
	gnome_desktop_thumbnail_is_valid applies atol(3) to mtime for
	comparison and time_t on GNU/Linux is a signed int.
	[0] https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-desktop/
	* lisp/image-dired.el (image-dired-create-thumb): Use floor here.

2016-12-17  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Fix spelling mistake in private defun name (Bug#25218)

	lisp/textmodes/flyspell.el (flyspell-ajust-cursor-point): Rename to

2016-12-17  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove XEmacs support from flyspell.el (Bug#25218)

	lisp/textmodes/flyspell.el (flyspell-prog-mode, flyspell-mode-on):

	(flyspell-correct-word-before-point): Remove XEmacs support.
	(flyspell-xemacs-popup): Remove XEmacs-specific defun.

2016-12-17  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	More tests for Tramp

	* lisp/net/tramp.el (tramp-drop-volume-letter): Handle quoted
	file names.

	* lisp/net/tramp-sh.el (tramp-make-copy-program-file-name): Quote file
	name properly.

	(tramp--test-windows-nt-and-batch)
	(tramp--test-windows-nt-and-pscp-psftp-p): New defuns.

2016-12-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Repair desktop restoration on text terminals

	* lisp/desktop.el (desktop-restoring-frameset-p): Test for the GUI
	frame here, instead of in desktop-restoring-frameset.  That's
	because desktop-read wants to know whether frameset will actually
	be restored, and has fallback procedures up its sleeve when it
	won't be; these fallbacks need to be invoked when the frameset is
	not going to be restored.  (Bug#24298)

2016-12-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix crashes on MS-Windows during dumping

	* src/unexw32.c (get_section_info): Make extra_bss_size be the
	maximum of extra_bss_size and extra_bss_size_static.  This avoids
	computing the size of the output file smaller than it actually
	needs to be, which then causes copy_executable_and_dump_data to
	write beyond the requested size of the file mapping, thus relying
	on the OS roundup to page boundary to save us from ourselves.  See
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-12/msg00642.html
	for the details.

	* lib/stdio-impl.h: Revert the workaround fix of not including
	errno.h for MinGW.

2016-12-17  Dmitry Gutov  <dgutov@yandex.ru>

	Ignore forward-sexp-function in js-mode indentation code

	* lisp/progmodes/js.el (js--multi-line-declaration-indentation)
	(js--maybe-goto-declaration-keyword-end):
	Bind forward-sexp-function to nil (bug#25215).

2016-12-16  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Be more selective clearing the image cache

	* lisp/image-dired.el (image-dired-create-thumbs):
	(image-dired-rotate-thumbnail, image-dired-refresh-thumb): Only clear
	the current thumbnail file from the image cache.

2016-12-16  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Unbreak the MinGW build

	* lib/stdio-impl.h [__MINGW32__]: Don't include errno.h.  Without

	Make seq-into return the sequence when no conversion needed

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el (seq-into): Do not convert the sequence when

2016-12-16  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	More image-dired refactoring

	(image-dired-display-image): Rearrange.
	(image-dired-copy-with-exif-file-name): This map is for side effect.
	(image-dired-dired-edit-comment-and-tags): Just use #'identity.

2016-12-16  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	This incorporates:
	2016-12-14 xalloc-oversized: check for PTRDIFF_MAX too

	(image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-program): Set type to file.
	(image-dired-create-thumb, image-dired-line-up-dynamic): Check storage
	type at runtime, since setting image-dired-thumb-size does not
	automatically set image-dired-thumb-width and image-dired-thumb-height.

2016-12-15  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Prevent crashes in xg_select due to concurrency

	* src/xgselect.c (xg_select): Don't call Glib functions that use
	'context' if we failed to acquire it.  This means some other
	thread owns the context, in which case both using the context and
	calling block_input/unblock_input will step on that thread's toes
	and eventually lead to crashes.  (Bug#25172)

2016-12-15  Nicolas Petton  <nicolas@petton.fr>

	Fix circular list handling in seq-mapn

2016-12-14  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Update standard image-dired thumbnail location

	* lisp/image-dired.el (image-dired-thumb-name): Conform to the latest
	standard: consider XDG_CACHE_HOME, falling back on ~/.cache.

2016-12-14  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Reset window scroll when displaying an image

	When viewing a large image full size and scrolling, for instance, to
	the lower right corner, then selecting a much smaller image in the
	thumbnail buffer, the window stays scrolled so the new image is out of
	the window.  One must scroll back to the "origin" to view the new
	displayed image, or just kill the image-dired-display-image buffer and
	try again.  This fixes the issue.
	* lisp/image-dired.el (image-dired-display-window-width):
	(image-dired-display-window-height): Operate on a window as argument.
	(image-dired-display-image): Bind (image-dired-display-window) and use
	it. Set window vscroll and hscroll to zero when refreshing the
	buffer's contents.

2016-12-14  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	More image-dired polish

	* lisp/image-dired.el (image-dired-file-name-at-point): New function.
	(image-dired-thumbnail-mode, image-dired-display-image-mode): Disable
	undo list. Add image-dired-file-name-at-point to
	file-name-at-point-functions to facilitate find-file and friends.
	(image-dired-thumbnail-display-external):
	(image-dired-dired-display-external): Use start-process instead, to
	avoid needlessly blocking and using a shell.

2016-12-13  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@russet.org.uk>

2016-12-13  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove meaningless defconst ispell-version

	* lisp/textmodes/ispell.el (ispell-version): Since ispell.el is now
	firmly part of Emacs, and the version hasn’t changed since 2003, and
	isn’t used anywhere, remove it.  3rd-party code can better use the
	Emacs version, or feature or function checks.
	(ispell-check-version): No longer report ispell.el version.

2016-12-13  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove boundp test for always-bound symbol

	bound.

2016-12-13  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove support for ispell < 3.1.12

2016-12-13  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Generalise over-specific documentation

	* lisp/textmodes/ispell.el (ispell-personal-dictionary): Rather than
	document precise personal wordlist filenames for only two supported
	spelling checkers, simply say that the default personal dictionary
	depends on the chosen spelling checker.  The user can check the
	spelling checker’s documentation if necessary.  This is simpler, and
	works for other supported (and future, or unknown) spelling checkers.

2016-12-13  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove tests for built-in functions

	* lisp/textmodes/ispell.el (buffer-substring-no-properties): Remove

	Remove ispell.el pre-GNU Emacs comments

	* lisp/textmodes/ispell.el (Commentary): Remove original maintainer
	  details, as Emacs version, bug report address and so forth should be
	  used instead for this version.  Remove in-line change history; use
	  git instead.

2016-12-13  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	* lisp/image-dired.el (image-dired-thumbnail-mode): Fix docstring to
	remove mention of nonexistent image-dired-dired and to refer to the
	new minor mode.
	(image-dired-minor-mode-map): New keymap assimilated from
	image-dired-setup-dired-keybindings.  In the future, the keymap parent
	should be removed, and perhaps also the duplicate bindings that
	already exist in dired-mode-map.
	(image-dired-setup-dired-keybindings): Remove.  Replace with an
	obsolete function alias.
	(image-dired-minor-mode): New minor mode, assuming the role of

2016-12-13  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Clean up var watcher disabling on thread switching

	* src/data.c (Fset_default): Move code into new C level function,
	`set_default_internal'.
	(set_default_internal): New function, like `Fset_default' but also takes
	additional bindflag parameter.
	(set_internal): Only call `notify_variable_watchers' if bindflag is not
	SET_INTERNAL_THREAD_SWITCH.
	* src/eval.c (do_specbind, do_one_unbind): Add bindflag parameter,
	passed on to set_internal and set_default_internal.  Adjust callers.
	(rebind_for_thread_switch, unbind_for_thread_switch): Pass
	SET_INTERNAL_THREAD_SWITCH to do_specbind, do_one_unbind instead of
	temporarily adjusting symbol's trapped_write field.

2016-12-13  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Minor fix for define-derived-mode

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/derived.el (define-derived-mode):
	Do not let eg eval-defun reset the values of syntax or abbrev tables,
	since they might have been defined externally.  (Bug#16160)

2016-12-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lisp/subr.el (backtrace--print-frame): New function.
	(backtrace): Reimplement using `backtrace--print-frame' and `mapbacktrace'.
	(backtrace-frame): Reimplement using `backtrace-frame--internal'.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/debug.el (debugger-setup-buffer): Pass a base to
	`mapbacktrace' instead of searching for "(debug" in the output of
	`backtrace'.

	* test/lisp/subr-tests.el (subr-test-backtrace-simple-tests)
	(subr-test-backtrace-integration-test): New tests.

	* doc/lispref/debugging.texi (Internals of Debugger): Document
	`mapbacktrace' and missing argument BASE of `backtrace-frame'.

2016-12-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use C99 syntax for font drivers

	Problem reported by Daniel Colascione in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-12/msg00515.html
	* src/ftcrfont.c (ftcrfont_driver):
	* src/ftfont.c (ftfont_driver):
	* src/ftxfont.c (ftxfont_driver):
	* src/macfont.m (macfont_driver):
	* src/nsfont.m (nsfont_driver):
	* src/xfont.c (xfont_driver):
	* src/xftfont.c (xftfont_driver):
	Use C99 syntax, not the old GNU C syntax.

2016-12-12  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Obsolete gs.el

	* lisp/gs.el: Move to lisp/obsolete.  (Bug#1524)
	* doc/lispref/display.texi (Image Formats): Remove postscript.
	(PostScript Images): Remove section.
	* doc/lispref/elisp.texi: Update menu.

2016-12-12  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Un-revert recent Ffset change

	* src/data.c (Ffset): Reinstate the check for "nil".

2016-12-12  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Minor advice.el fix

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/advice.el (ad-preactivate-advice):
	Avoid setting the function definition of nil.
	This was happening during bootstrap of org-compat.el,
	apparently due to eager macro expansion of code behind
	a (featurep 'xemacs) test.

2016-12-12  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Make etags-tests work in out-of-tree builds

	* test/lisp/progmodes/etags-tests.el (etags-bug-158)
	(etags-bug-23164): Make them work in an out-of-tree build.
	Reported by Ken Brown <kbrown@cornell.edu>.

2016-12-12  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Avoid crashing if a new thread is signaled right away

	* src/thread.c (post_acquire_global_lock): Don't raise the pending
	signal if the thread's handlers were not yet set up, as that will
	cause Emacs to exit with a fatal error.  This can happen if a
	thread is signaled as soon as make-thread returns, before the new
	thread had an opportunity to acquire the global lock, set up the
	handlers, and call the thread function.

	* test/src/thread-tests.el (thread-signal-early): New test.

2016-12-12  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix point motion in cloned buffers

	* src/thread.c (post_acquire_global_lock): Call
	set_buffer_internal_2 instead of tricking set_buffer_internal_1
	into resetting the current buffer even if it didn't change.  This
	avoids bug#25165, caused by failing to record the modified values
	of point and mark, because current_buffer was set to NULL.  Also,
	don't bother re-setting the buffer if there was no thread switch,
	as that just wastes cycles.
	* src/buffer.c (set_buffer_internal_2): New function, with most of
	the body of set_buffer_internal_1, but without the test for B
	being identical to the current buffer.
	(set_buffer_internal_1): Call set_buffer_internal_2 if B is not
	identical to the current buffer.
	* src/buffer.h (set_buffer_internal_2): Add prototype.

	* test/src/thread-tests.el (thread-sticky-point): New test.

2016-12-12  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* lisp/net/tramp-adb.el (tramp-adb-handle-file-local-copy)
	(tramp-adb-handle-write-region): Unquote localname.
	(tramp-adb-handle-copy-file): Implement direct copy on remote device.

	(tramp-gvfs-connection-mounted-p, tramp-gvfs-mount-spec)
	(tramp-gvfs-maybe-open-connection):
	* lisp/net/tramp-sh.el (tramp-make-copy-program-file-name):
	* lisp/net/tramp-smb.el (tramp-smb-get-share)
	(tramp-smb-get-localname): Use it.

	* test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el (tramp--test-docker-p): New defun.
	(tramp--test-special-characters, tramp-test34-utf8)
	(tramp-test34-utf8-with-stat, tramp-test34-utf8-with-perl)
	(tramp-test34-utf8-with-ls): Use it.

2016-12-12  Martin Rudalics  <rudalics@gmx.at>

	Strengthen conditions for resizing sibling windows (Bug#25169)

	* lisp/window.el (window-resize, delete-window): Resize other siblings
	only if `window-combination-resize' equals t (Bug#25169).

2016-12-12  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Quote filenames containing '~' in prompts

	When in a directory named '~', the default value given by
	`read-file-name' should be quoted by prepending '/:', in order to
	prevent it from being interpreted as referring to the $HOME
	directory (Bug#16984).

	* lisp/minibuffer.el (minibuffer-maybe-quote-filename): New function.
	(completion--sifn-requote, read-file-name-default): Use it instead of
	`minibuffer--double-dollars'.
	* test/lisp/files-tests.el (files-test-read-file-in-~): Test it.

2016-12-11  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Undo part of last change

	* src/thread.h:
	* src/keyboard.c:
	* src/keyboard.h: Undo part of last change:
	input_available_clear_time is again a global variable.

2016-12-11  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Avoid aborts when a thread signals an error

	* src/thread.h (struct thread_state): Add members
	m_waiting_for_input and m_input_available_clear_time.
	(waiting_for_input, input_available_clear_time): New macros.
	* src/keyboard.c (waiting_for_input, input_available_clear_time):
	Remove; they are now macros that reference the current thread.
	(Bug#25171)
	* src/w32select.c: Don't include keyboard.h.

	* test/src/thread-tests.el (thread-errors): New test.

2016-12-11  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Clean up compile-tests.el

	Switch to lexical binding.  Make checkdoc happy.

	* test/lisp/progmodes/compile-tests.el (compile--test-error-line)
	(compile-test-error-regexps): Instead of checking a single Boolean
	value, use `should' for each attribute of the message to be compared.
	(compile-tests--test-regexps-data): Document sixth list element
	TYPE.

2016-12-11  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	eager macro-expansion failures.

2016-12-11  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Tweaks for message bogus address detection

	* lisp/gnus/message.el (message-bogus-recipient-p):
	Do not require "@", since some mailers deliver to local addresses
	without one.  (Bug#23054)
	Move "@.*@" from here...
	(message-bogus-addresses): ...to here, so it can be customized.

2016-12-11  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

2016-12-11  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Bump makeinfo requirement from 4.7 to 4.13

	* configure.ac: Bump makeinfo version requirement from 4.7 to 4.13.
	We need at least 4.8, and that may be buggy, so go for the last
	of the 4 series, which is 8 years old.  (Bug#25108)

2016-12-11  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	Minor shell-mode fix for zsh

	* lisp/shell.el (shell-mode): Prevent shell-dirstack-query
	becoming confused by zsh abbreviations.  (Bug#24632)

2016-12-10  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Define struct predicate before acccesors

	The accessor functions use the predicate function, which causes problems
	when reloading after unload-feature: the compiler-macro property is
	still present on the predicate symbol, and the compiler fails to find
	the definition when trying to inline it into the accessor
	function (Bug#25088).

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-macs.el (cl-defstruct): Move predicate definition
	before field accessor definitions.

2016-12-10  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

	* Makefile.in (install-etc): Don't prepend $(DESTDIR) to commands in
	system unit file.

2016-12-09  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix subtle errors with let-binding of localized variables

	* src/eval.c (do_specbind): Don't require a "symbol" that is
	actually a cons cell, in order to call set-default, as there are
	no longer such bindings.  This makes do_specbind work like the
	pre-concurrency implementation in specbind for bindings of

2016-12-09  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix bad quoting of python-shell-interpreter

	`python-shell-calculate-command' was using `shell-quote-argument' as if
	it was generating a shell command, but its callers don't pass the result
	to a shell, and they expect to parse it with `split-string-and-unquote'.
	This caused problems depending on the flavor of shell quoting in
	effect (Bug#25025).

	* lisp/progmodes/python.el (python-shell-calculate-command): Use
	`combine-and-quote-strings' to quote the interpreter, so that it can be
	parsed by `python-shell-make-comint' successfully using
	`split-string-and-unquote'.

2016-12-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/lisp.h (struct terminal): Remove unnecessary forward decl.

2016-12-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Make read1 more reentrant

	This is needed if ‘read’ is called soon after startup, before the
	Unicode tables have been set up, and it reads a \N escape and
	needs to look up a value the Unicode tables, a lookup that in turn
	calls read1 recursively.  Although this change doesn’t make ‘read’
	fully reentrant, it’s good enough to handle this case.
	* src/lread.c (read_buffer_size, read_buffer): Remove static vars.
	(grow_read_buffer): Revamp to use locals, not statics, and to
	record memory allocation un the specpdl.  All callers changed.

	* likewise, exiting a thread should clear current_thread
	* redundant assignment in run_thread
	* clean up init_threads - no need to re-init the primary thread

	This patch still sometimes causes weird hangs in "make check".
	However, I think that is a kernel bug, since Emacs enters the zombie

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	process changes

	This changes wait_reading_process_output to handle threads better.  It
	introduces a wrapper for select that releases the global lock, and it
	ensures that only a single thread can select a given file descriptor
	at a time.

	This also adds the thread-locking feature to processes.  By default a
	process can only have its output accepted by the thread that created
	it.  This can be changed using set-process-thread.  (If the thread
	exits, the process is again available for waiting by any thread.)

	Note that thread-signal will not currently interrupt a thread blocked
	on select.  I'll fix this later.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This adds thread-blocker, a function to examine what a thread is
	blocked on.  I thought this would be another nice debugging addition.

	This adds names to mutexes.  This seemed like a nice debugging
	extension.

	This adds some tests of the threading code.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This supplies the mutex implementation for Emacs Lisp.

	A lisp mutex is implemented using a condition variable, so that we can
	interrupt a mutex-lock operation by calling thread-signal on the
	blocking thread.  I did things this way because pthread_mutex_lock
	can't readily be interrupted.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This adds most of the thread features visible to emacs lisp.

	I roughly followed the Bordeaux threads API:

	http://trac.common-lisp.net/bordeaux-threads/wiki/ApiDocumentation

	... but not identically.  In particular I chose not to implement
	interrupt-thread or destroy-thread, but instead a thread-signalling
	approach.

	I'm still undecided about *default-special-bindings* (which I did not
	implement).  I think it would be more emacs-like to capture the let
	bindings at make-thread time, but IIRC Stefan didn't like this idea
	the first time around.

	There are one or two semantics issues pointed out in the patch where I
	could use some advice.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This turns thread_state into a pseudovector and updates various bits
	of Emacs to cope.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This introduces some new functions to handle the specpdl.  The basic
	idea is that when a thread loses the interpreter lock, it will unbind
	the bindings it has put in place.  Then when a thread acquires the
	lock, it will restore its bindings.

	This code reuses an existing empty slot in struct specbinding to store
	the current value when the thread is "swapped out".

	This approach performs worse than my previously planned approach.
	However, it was one I could implement with minimal time and
	brainpower.  I hope that perhaps someone else could improve the code
	once it is in.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This introduces the low-level system threading support.  It also adds
	the global lock.  The low-level support is a bit over-eager, in that
	even at the end of the present series, it will not all be used.  I
	think thiat is ok since I plan to use it all eventually -- in
	particular for the emacs lisp mutex implementation.

	I've only implemented the pthreads-based version.  I think it should
	be relatively clear how to port this to other systems, though.

	I'd also like to do a "no threads" port that will turn most things
	into no-ops, and have thread-creation fail.  I was thinking perhaps
	I'd make a future (provide 'threads) conditional on threads actually
	working.

	One other minor enhancement available here is to make it possible to
	set the name of the new thread at the OS layer.  That way gdb, e.g.,
	could display thread names.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This parameterizes the GC a bit to make it thread-ready.

	The basic idea is that whenever a thread "exits lisp" -- that is,
	releases the global lock in favor of another thread -- it must save
	its stack boundaries in the thread object.  This way the boundaries
	are always available for marking.  This is the purpose of
	flush_stack_call_func.

	I haven't tested this under all the possible GC configurations.
	There is a new FIXME in a spot that i didn't convert.

	Arguably all_threads should go in the previous patch.

2012-08-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	This introduces a thread-state object and moves various C globals
	there.  It also introduces #defines for these globals to avoid a
	monster patch.

	The #defines mean that this patch also has to rename a few fields
	whose names clash with the defines.

	There is currently just a single "thread"; so this patch does not
	impact Emacs behavior in any significant way.

	Prefer FUNCTIONP (x) to !NILP (Ffunctionp (x)).
	* src/eval.c (FUNCTIONP): Move here ...
	* src/lisp.h: ... from here.  No longer inline, as that

2016-12-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't assume window-point and point are the same

	The function `cursor-sensor--detect' calls `bobp' to decide whether to
	check properties at (1- (window-point)).  However, (window-point) may be
	at beginning of buffer, even if (point) is not.  In this case an
	`args-out-of-range' error will be signaled (Bug#25104).

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cursor-sensor.el (cursor-sensor--detect): Check the
	value of (window-point) against (point-min), rather than (bobp) to
	decide if (1- (window-point)) is accessible.

	Give test-completion's PREDICATE the hashtable key

	For hashtable entries with symbol keys, `test-completion' would convert

	* src/minibuf.c (Ftest_completion): Pass original key from hashtable.

2016-12-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Give test-completion's PREDICATE full alist entry

	Since 2016-06-26 "Fix test-completion with completion-regexp-list", when
	calling test-completion with an alist collection, the predicate was
	recieving the string value instead of the alist entry (Bug#24966).

	* src/minibuf.c (Ftest_completion): Don't modify the found element, just
	test STRING against `completion-regexp-list'.
	* test/src/minibuf-tests.el: New tests for `try-completion',
	`all-completions', and `test-completion'.

2016-12-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix ert-tests when running compiled

	* test/lisp/emacs-lisp/ert-tests.el (ert-test-deftest): Don't test for
	specific macroexpansion, just check result of evaluation.
	(ert-test-record-backtrace): Don't hardcode representation of closure in
	expected backtrace, this lets the test succeed even when the test code
	is compiled.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/ert.el (ert--expand-should-1): Also pass
	`byte-compile-macro-environment' to `macroexpand', this allows the
	`should' macro to properly handle macroexpansion of macros that were
	defined in the same file when it's being compiled (Bug #17851).

2016-12-06  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

2016-12-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Change two _Noreturn functions to return void

	This is a bit clearer than _Noreturn functions that (do not)

	* src/callproc.c (call_process) [MSDOS]:
	Use 'status' local to record status.
	(child_setup): Return CHILD_SETUP_TYPE.
	* src/data.c, src/lisp.h (wrong_type_argument): Return void.
	All callers changed.

	* lisp/gnus/mm-decode.el (mm-convert-shr-links): Avoid `shr-next-link'

	`widget-backward' instead (bug#25091).

2016-12-05  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Improve diff-mode navigation/manipulation

	This is Bug #17544.

	Navigation and use of diff buffers had several annoying corner cases
	that this patch fixes.  These corner cases were largely due to
	inconsistent treatment of file headers.  Say you have a diff such as
	this:

	 --- aaa
	 +++ bbb
	 @@ -52,7 +52,7 @@
	 hunk1
	 @@ -74,7 +74,7 @@
	 hunk2
	 --- ccc
	 +++ ddd
	 @@ -608,6 +608,6 @@
	 hunk3
	 @@ -654,7 +654,7 @@
	 hunk4

	The file headers here are the '---' and '+++' lines.  With the point on
	such a line, hunk operations would sometimes refer to the next hunk and
	sometimes to the previous hunk.  Most of the time it would be the
	previous hunk, which is not what the user would expect.  This patch
	consistently treats such headers as the next hunk.  So with this patch,
	if the point is on the '--- ccc' line, the point is seen as referring to
	hunk3.

	Specific behaviors this fixes are:

	1. It should be possible to place the point in the middle of a diff
	buffer, and press M-k repeatedly to kill hunks in the order they appear
	in the buffer.  With the point on hunk1, M-k M-k would kill hunk1 then
	hunk2.  With the point on hunk3, it would kill hunk3 then hunk4; this is
	fine.  However, with the point on hunk2, it'd kill hunk2 then hunk1.
	This is fixed by this patch.

	2. Similarly, it should be possible to apply hunks in order.  Previously
	with the point at the start, C-c C-a would apply the hunk1, then move
	the point to the first @@ header, and thus C-c C-a would try to apply
	the same hunk again.

	* lisp/vc/diff-mode.el (diff--wrap-navigation): New function to add better
	navigation logic to diff-{hunk,file}-{next,prev}.
	(diff-hunk-next, diff-hunk-prev):
	(diff-file-next, diff-file-prev): Better navigation logic if
	skip-hunk-start is true, which happens when called interactively.
	(diff-bounds-of-hunk, diff-find-source-location):
	(diff-apply-hunk, diff-current-defun, diff-refine-hunk): Small tweaks to
	improve hunk navigation.

	Fix undefined refs on some GNU/Linux hosts

	Problem reported by Ken Raeburn in:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-11/msg00463.html
	* src/emacs.c (heap_bss_diff) [CANNOT_DUMP]: Remove, as this is
	not needed in the CANNOT_UNDUMP case.  All uses removed.  This
	removes unwanted references to my_endbss and my_endbss_static,
	which are not optimized away on some platforms.

2016-11-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Make CANNOT_DUMP work better on GNU/Linux

	Clean up some of the bitrot affecting the CANNOT_DUMP code.  This
	lets the build succeed again, and fixes the testing framework so
	that most test cases now pass.  About twenty test cases still
	fail, though, and we still have Bug#24974.
	* configure.ac (CANNOT_DUMP): Now empty if CANNOT_DUMP.
	(SYSTEM_MALLOC): Now true if CANNOT_DUMP.  There should no longer
	be any point to messing with a private memory allocator unless
	Emacs is dumping.

	* src/image.c (reset_image_types):
	* src/lastfile.c (my_endbss, _my_endbss, my_endbss_static):

	(daemon_pipe) [!WINDOWSNT]: Now static.
	* test/Makefile.in (mostlyclean): Remove *.tmp files.

2016-11-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Pacify --enable-gcc-warnings CANNOT_DUMP=yes

	* src/editfns.c (dump_tz_string) [CANNOT_DUMP || !HAVE_TZSET]:

	* lisp/ibuffer.el (ibuffer-compile-format): Use string-width instead of length

2016-11-20  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix redrawing non-selected frame after resize on MS-Windows

	* src/xdisp.c (redisplay_internal): If all the frames were
	successfully updated, reset the "garbaged" flag of each frame, to
	make sure it doesn't stay set.

	* src/w32term.c (w32_read_socket): Don't clear the frame if it's
	"garbaged", since expose_frame won't redraw the foreground then.

	When `vc-git-print-log-follow' is true and all files are
	non-directory, pass "--follow" to "git log".
	This works around bug#8756 and bug#16422.

2016-11-14  Sam Steingold  <sds@gnu.org>

	Improve case-insensitive checks (Bug#24441)

	* doc/lispref/files.texi (Truenames): Simplify documentation,
	to avoid giving too much platform-specific information that
	may not be accurate anyway.
	* src/fileio.c (file_name_case_insensitive_p): Use pathconf with
	_PC_CASE_SENSITIVE if _PC_CASE_INSENSITIVE is not available.
	Otherwise if one approach fails (e.g., with errno == EINVAL), fall
	back on an alternative rather than returning false.  Try skipping
	the Darwin code, as it (1) no longer seems to be needed and (2)
	does not seem to match the Apple documentation.  Leave in two
	alternatives conditionally compiled based on
	DARWIN_OS_CASE_SENSITIVE_FIXME in case (1) or (2) is incorrect.

	Port --enable-gcc-warnings to Ubuntu 16.10

	* src/gmalloc.c: Include <stdlib.h>, so it declares
	hybrid_aligned_alloc (the definiens of the aligned_alloc macro),
	so that GCC doesn't complain that hybrid_aligned_alloc is
	defined without being declared.

2016-11-13  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	Silence tramp warning

	* lisp/net/tramp.el (tramp-file-name-for-operation): Add

	parent mode is special-mode.
	(quickurl-format-url, quickurl-sort-urls): New functions.
	(quickurl-read, quickurl): Use defun, as no cl-defun feature appears to
	be used.
	(quickurl-list-mode): Derive from special-mode.  Nix setting
	buffer-read-only: special-mode does that.
	(quickurl-list-populate-buffer): Use dolist instead.
	(quickurl-list-quit): Use quit-window.  It looks like this was written
	before the quit-window rewrite.  quit-window is very useful now.

2016-11-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port to FreeBSD 11 AMD

	Problem reported by Ashish Shukla (Bug#24892).  I tested
	this on FreeBSD 11 x86-64 with HAVE_SBRK manually undefined.
	* configure.ac (system_malloc): Set to 'yes' if there is no sbrk.
	(sbrk): Check whether it exists.
	* src/alloc.c (my_heap_start) [!GNU_LINUX]:
	Do not define, since this function is now used only on GNU/Linux,
	and sbrk might not exist on other platforms.
	(malloc_initialize_hook) [!GNU_LINUX]:
	Do not call my_heap_start, since its side effect will never be used.
	(Fmemory_limit) [!HAVE_SBRK]: Do not call sbrk.
	* src/unexelf.c (unexec) [!HAVE_SBRK]: Assume that nothing like
	sbrk exists.

2016-11-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port emacsclient to FreeBSD 11 etc.

	* lib-src/emacsclient.c: Include <string.h>.  This is needed on
	platforms like FreeBSD 11 that use code involving strlen etc., and
	because <config.h> no longer includes string.h.

2016-11-07  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Prescribe history for read-regexp in query-replace

	In the fix for bug#24580, the history argument for read-regexp was
	removed erroneously; read-regexp's history argument defaults to
	regexp-history, not minibuffer-history.
	* lisp/replace.el (query-replace-read-from): Tell read-regexp to use
	minibuffer-history.  Fixes bug#24873.

	Disable bracketed paste in a terminal in char mode

	In char mode, a terminal doesn't accept bracketed paste events,

	least one buffer in a terminal, it is disabled for the whole terminal.

	* lisp/term/xterm.el (xterm-inhibit-bracketed-paste-mode): New mode to
	inhibit XTerm bracketed paste per buffer.
	(xterm--buffer-terminals, xterm--update-bracketed-paste)

	functions.
	(xterm--init-bracketed-paste-mode): Remove unused helper

	Fix compilation with MinGW runtime 3.22.2 and w32api 3.18.2

	* nt/inc/ms-w32.h (_WIN32_WINNT) [!MINGW_W64]: Undefine before
	defining to avoid redefinition warnings.

	* nt/inc/sys/stat.h (_SYS_STAT_H, _INC_STAT_H): Define, to avoid
	inclusion of sys/stat.h from the system headers, which could then
	lead to compilation errors due to redefinition of 'struct stat'
	etc.  This is needed because latest versions of MinGW runtime
	include sys/stat.h from wchar.h.

	Document and fix some bugs with side windows

	Add a documentation for side windows and fix some bugs
	found when testing their behavior.  Also add a new window
	parameter `no-delete-other-window', a new `display-buffer'
	alist member called `window-parameters', and functions to
	toggle and reverse side windows on a frame.  Add new function

	`delete-window' parameter.  Add `preserve-size' entry to ALIST.
	(delete-side-window): Remove function.
	(display-buffer-in-side-window): Fix doc-string.  Don't set
	`delete-window' parameter.  Add `preserve-size' entry to ALIST.
	(window--side-check): Rename to window--sides-check.  Rewrite
	completely.  Adjust caller.
	(window-resize-no-error): Don't describe PIXELWISE argument.
	(adjust-window-trailing-edge): Fix bug that disallowed
	re-enlarging windows that were too small.
	(window-deletable-p): Don't tell that a minibuffer window on a
	non-minibuffer-only frame can be deleted.  Fix doc-string.
	(delete-window): Handle deleting a side window here (the
	`delete-window' parameter is no more set for side windows).
	(delete-other-windows): Handle ‘no-delete-other-window'
	parameter. Don't treat side windows separately (see discussion
	of Bug#24368) but keep optimization that makes the main window

	windows and buffers shown in side windows separately.
	(split-window-no-error): New function.

	was not preserved.
	(window-state-put): When reducing an internal window to a live
	one, don't choose a side window.

	doc-string.
	(display-buffer-at-bottom): Call `split-window-no-error'.

	* doc/lispref/elisp.texi (Top): New section "Side Windows".
	* doc/lispref/windows.texi (Deleting Windows): Fix descriptions
	of `delete-window' and `delete-other-windows' wrt window

	(Display Action Functions): Mention `window-parameters' ALIST
	entry.
	(Side Windows): New section (Bug#18170).

	Restart blink cursor timers on interval changes

	This prevents surprising behavior when timer interval customizations are
	only applied whenever the timers happen to be restarted (see Bug#24372).

	* lisp/frame.el (blink-cursor--start-idle-timer)
	(blink-cursor--start-timer): New functions.
	(blink-cursor-start, blink-cursor-check, blink-cursor-mode): Use
	the new helper functions.

	the value is changed.

2016-10-01  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Use a simple keyword for a non-nil argument

	The second argument of `run-with-idle-timer' is Boolean, i.e. only nil
	and non-nil values are distinguished.  Passing a number here is
	confusing.  Pass a descriptive symbol instead.

	* lisp/frame.el (blink-cursor-mode, blink-cursor-check): Use
	:repeat symbol instead of number for second argument of
	`run-with-idle-timer'

2016-10-01  Philipp Stephani  <phst@google.com>

	Avoid compilation warning on MinGW

	* src/w32.c: Include string.h, needed for the prototype of
	'strerror', shadowed by 'sys_strerror'.  This avoids a compiler
	warning about "no previous prototype".  The string.h header
	must be included after ms-w32.h, but before "#undef strerror".

	present in output.

2016-09-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Limit <config.h>’s includes

	This follows up on recent problems with the fact that config.h
	includes stdlib.h etc.; some files need to include stdlib.h later.
	config.h generally should limit itself to includes that are
	universally safe; outside of MS-Windows, only stdbool.h makes
	the cut among the files currently included.  So, move the
	other includes to just the files that need them (Bug#24506).
	* configure.ac (config_opsysfile): Remove, as this generic hook
	is no longer needed.
	* lib-src/etags.c, src/unexmacosx.c, src/w32.c, src/w32notify.c:
	* src/w32proc.c (_GNU_SOURCE):
	Remove, as it’s OK for config.h to do this now.
	* src/conf_post.h: Include <ms-w32.h>, instead of the generic
	config_opsysfile, for simplicity as this old way of configuring is
	now done only for the MS-Windows port.  Do not include <ms-w32.h>
	if DEFER_MS_W32_H, for the benefit of the few files that want its
	effects later.  Do not include <alloca.h>, <string.h>, or
	<stdlib.h>.  Other files modified to include these headers as
	needed, or to not include headers that are no longer needed.
	* src/lisp.h: Include <alloca.h> and <string.h> here, since
	some of the inline functions need them.
	* src/regex.c: Include <alloca.h> if not emacs.  (If emacs,
	we can rely on SAFE_ALLOCA.)  There is no longer any need to
	worry about HAVE_ALLOCA_H.
	* src/unexmacosx.c: Rely on config.h not including stdlib.h.
	* src/w32.c, src/w32notify.c, src/w32proc.c (DEFER_MS_W32_H):
	Define before including <config.h> first, and include <ms-w32.h>
	after the troublesome headers.

	Correctly fontify C++ direct initializations with parens inside functions

	Or, more clearly, when something looks like a function declaration and it's
	inside a function, fontify it as a direct initialization.

	For this purpose, introduce a "brace stack" for each buffer, where an entry on
	the brace stack states how deeply nested a particular position is inside
	braces inside a "top level", which includes classes and namespaces.

	Also introduce a new "context", "top", with which c-font-lock-declarations
	signals to c-forward-decl-or-cast-1 that point is at the top level.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-langs.el (c-get-state-before-change-functions): add
	c-truncate-bs-cache.
	(c-flat-decl-block-kwds, c-brace-stack-thing-key, c-brace-stack-no-semi-key)
	(c-type-decl-operator-prefix-key): new language constants/variables.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-bs-interval, c-bs-cache, c-bs-cache-limit)
	(c-bs-prev-pos, c-bs-prev-stack): New mostly local variables for the brace
	stack cache.
	(c-init-bs-cache, c-truncate-bs-cache, c-truncate-bs-cache, c-brace-stack-at)
	(c-bs-at-toplevel-p): New functions which manipulate the brace stack (cache).
	(c-find-decl-prefix-search): Keep track of whether we're at top level.
	(c-find-decl-spots): New local variable cfd-top-level which records what it
	says.  On calling cfd-fun, pass cfd-top-level as an additional argument.
	(c-forward-declarator): Add new element DECORATED to the result list.  Set it
	to non-nil when a match for c-type-decl-operator-prefix-key is found.
	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Handle the newly introduced context "top".
	Introduce "CASE 9.5", which recognizes direct initializations.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-complex-decl-prepare)
	(c-font-lock-enum-tail, c-font-lock-cut-off-declarators)
	(c-font-lock-enclosing-decls, c-simple-decl-matchers, c-basic-matchers-after):
	Add appropriate `not-top' argument to calls to c-font-lock-declarators.
	(c-font-lock-declarators): Additional parameter `not-top'.  Use not-top to
	participate in the decision whether to fontify an identifier as a function or
	a variable.
	(c-font-lock-declarations): The internal lambda function takes an additional
	argument `toplev' from c-find-decl-spots, which it uses in determining the
	"context" of a declaration.  Add appropriate `not-top' argument to calls to
	c-font-lock-declarators.
	(c-font-lock-objc-methods): Add extra parameter to internal lambda function,
	like for c-font-lock-declarators.

	cache.

	Split regex character class test into smaller chunks

	Having one test for all character classes it is not always trivial to

	Remove dead loop iterations in regex.c

	RE_CHAR_TO_MULTIBYTE(c) yields c for ASCII characters and a byte8
	character for c ≥ 0x80.  Furthermore, CHAR_BYTE8_P(c) is true only
	for byte8 characters.  This means that

		c = RE_CHAR_TO_MULTIBYTE (ch);
		if (! CHAR_BYTE8_P (c) && re_iswctype (c, cc))

	is equivalent to:

		c = c;
		if (! false && re_iswctype (c, cc))

	for 0 ⪬ c < 0x80, and

		c = BYTE8_TO_CHAR (c);
		if (! true && re_iswctype (c, cc))

	for 0x80 ⪬ c < 0x100.  In other words, the loop never executes for
	c ≥ 0x80 and RE_CHAR_TO_MULTIBYTE call is unnecessary for c < 0x80.

	Port flexible array members to GCC + valgrind

	These changes are needed to conform to the C standard's rule for
	allocating structs containing flexible array members.  C11 says
	that malloc (offsetof (struct s, m) + n) does not suffice to
	allocate a struct with an n-byte tail; instead, malloc’s arg
	should be rounded up to the nearest multiple of alignof (struct s).
	Although this is arguably a defect in C11, gcc -O2 + valgrind
	sometimes complains when this rule is violated, and when debugging
	it’s better to keep valgrind happy.
	For details please see the thread containing the message at:
	https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-09/msg00416.html

	Avoid assertion violations when scrolling narrowed buffer

	* src/window.c (window_scroll_pixel_based):
	* src/xdisp.c (pos_visible_p): Don't allow simulated redisplay to
	start outside the accessible portion of the buffer.  This avoids
	assertion violations when some Lisp narrows the buffer to less
	than the current window, and then attempts to scroll the buffer.

2016-09-05  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Treat SIGINT correctly in GUI sessions on MS-Windows

	* src/w32proc.c (sys_signal): Don't reject SIGINT, as it is
	supported by MS runtime.
	* src/term.c (DEV_TTY): Move from here ...
	* src/conf_post.h (DEV_TTY): ... to here.  Separate definitions
	for WINDOWSNT and for the rest.
	* src/keyboard.c (handle_interrupt_signal): Use DEV_TTY instead of
	a literal "/dev/tty".

	* etc/NEWS: Mention the behavior change.

2016-09-03  Robert Cochran  <robert-git@cochranmail.com>

	Fix uses of (call-interactively) in lisp/emacs-lisp/checkdoc.el

	Passing the prefix argument as the 3rd argument to 'call-interactively'
	causes the prefix argument to be interpreted as events, which is not
	only wrong, but also causes a type error, as 'current-prefix-arg' can
	never be a vector as 'call-interactively' expects.  'call-interactively'
	automatically passes its prefix argument to the called function, so just
	do that, eliminating faulty behavior.

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/checkdoc.el (checkdoc-ispell):
	(checkdoc-ispell-current-buffer):
	(checkdoc-ispell-interactive):

2016-09-01  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Fix c-declaration-limits to return correct limits in all cases.

	This function is the guts of c-indent-defun and c-mark-function.

	In particular, when c-defun-tactic is nil, return a correct value rather than
	always nil, and when it's 'go-outward, go through an intricate algorithm to
	determine the requisite narrowing before the "top-level" defuns go to work.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-cmds.el (c-narrow-to-most-enclosing-decl-block): Enhance
	to take additional optional parameter LEVEL, saying how many enclosing levels
	of decl-block to narrow to.
	(c-declaration-limits): Introduce algorithm to determine narrowing.  Use
	c-where-wrt-to-brace-block to determine whether to go back to BOD to determine
	lower bound.

	* lisp/htmlfontify.el (htmlfontify-buffer):
	Spell out character names, for clarity.  The old doc string
	generated the *Help* text ‘^L ([FF]) or ¤ (244)’, where ‘[FF]’

	Fix rules for \phi and \varphi which were reversed

	* lisp/leim/quail/latin-ltx.el: Special-case phi/varphi because those

	Memory allocator alignment fixes

	These changes remove some assumptions about heap allocator
	alignment that may not be true on unusual platforms.
	* src/alloc.c (POWER_OF_2): New macro.
	(ROUNDUP): Use it.
	(BLOCK_ALIGN): Verify that it is a power of 2.
	(aligned_alloc): Check that alignment passed to posix_memalign
	satisfies POSIX restrictions.
	(lisp_align_malloc): Check that size passed to aligned_alloc
	satisfies C11 restrictions.
	(MALLOC_IS_GC_ALIGNED): Check that GCALIGNMENT is 8, since the
	code has not been verified to work with other GCALIGNMENT values
	and the ice is thin here.  On GNU/Linux, malloc can return a value
	that is a multiple of 8 but not 16, even though __alignof__
	(max_align_t) is 16.  See:
	https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-08/msg01902.html
	(lmalloc) [USE_ALIGNED_ALLOC]: Use aligned_alloc only if size
	is a multiple of alignment, since C11 says the behavior is
	undefined otherwise.
	(lmalloc, lrealloc): Don't use INT_ADD_WRAPV on size_t, as in
	general this macro is restricted to signed types.  Remove
	assertion that the result is a multiple of GCALIGNMENT, as that
	need not be true.

2016-08-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	problem.

	the loop won't hang at a "terminating" paren of a different type (due to the
	c-syntactic-re-search-forward at the end of the loop stopping at such
	characters).

	any provided format and force to 8.
	(x_window_property_intern): If returning value as a string, the length
	is actual_size times the actual format of each element, which is not

	Adapt CC Mode for C++11 uniform initialization.

	For fontification, introduce a new "context", 'non-decl, to be used for
	brace
	lists; also a new value for the property 'c-type, called 'c-not-decl.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-back-over-compound-identifier): Check that
	an ostensible symbol we're going to move over isn't a keyword.
	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): CASE 1: Where we have two consecutive identifiers
	(hence a declaration), and an unmatched open paren, perform
	c-fdoc-shift-type-backwards to recognize the partial construct correctly.
	Whilst checking a type decl expression, check for and handle C++11's "copy
	initialization", where we have <type>(<constant>).  Recognize
	<id><id>(... (where the paren is unclosed) as a declaration.
	(c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist): New function, extracted from
	c-inside-bracelist-p.  Recognize as bracelists "{"s which are preceded by
	valid tokens other than "=".  Recognize a bracelist when preceded by a
	template declaration.
	(c-inside-bracelist-p): Call c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist in place of
	much inline code.
	(c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Amend so that it won't wrongly recognise an
	initialization starting "({" as an in-expression block, by checking for
	semicolons, as opposed to commas, separating elements inside it.
	(c-guess-continued-construct): (CASE B-2): Recognize a brace-list-open by
	calling c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist rather than checking for a
	preceding "=".  (CASE B-5): New code to recognize new construct "return {
	...}".
	(c-guess-basic-syntax): (CASE 5A.3): Additionally recognize a "{" preceded by
	"return", or "{" preceded by <type><identifier> as a bracelist.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Recognize brace
	lists, giving them `context' 'non-decl.  Pass over elements of one by regexp
	search for "," rather than calling c-forward-decl-or-cast-1.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-langs.el (c-return-kwds, c-return-key): New lang
	constants/variables to recognize "return".
	(c-pre-id-bracelist-key): New lang constant/variable to recognize tokens
	which, when preceding an identifier followed by a brace, signify the brace as
	a bracelist.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-mode.el (c-fl-decl-start): When searching outwards for
	the start of a "local" declaration, move out from an enclosing brace when
	that is the start of a brace list.

2016-08-21  Martin Rudalics  <rudalics@gmx.at>

	Fix semantics of 'minibuffer' frame parameter

	The 'minibuffer' frame parameter is now t for a normal frame
	(a frame with a root window plus a minibuffer window) and the
	frame's minibuffer window for a minibuffer-less frame (a frame
	whose minibuffer window is on another frame).  See also:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-07/msg01259.html

	* src/frame.c (make_frame, make_frame_without_minibuffer)
	(make_minibuffer_frame): When assigning the frame's minibuffer
	window also store corresponding 'minibuffer' frame parameter.
	(store_frame_param): Move the 'minibuffer' parameter checks to
	the beginning so we can silently override the value before it
	gets stored in the parameter alist.  Fix error handling.
	(Fframe_parameters): Return value of 'minibuffer' parameter
	unmodified.

	* lisp/frameset.el (frameset-filter-minibuffer): When the cdr of
	the parameter is a minibuffer window, save (minibuffer . nil)
	instead of (minibuffer . t).
	(frameset--reuse-frame): To find a non-minibuffer-only frame
	look out for a frame whose 'minibuffer' parameter is t instead
	of that frame's minibuffer window.
	(frameset-minibufferless-first-p): To find a minibuffer-less
	frame look out for a frame whose 'minibuffer' parameter is a
	window instead of nil.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-defs.el (c-safe-scan-lists): Resolve overelaborate "nil"

2016-08-20  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	In c-\(go-\)?-\(up-\|down-\)?list-\(forward\|backward\) check limit isn't nil

	Check the limit both at macro expansion time (for a hard coded nil) and at run
	time in the generated code.  Tidy up these macros generally.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-defs.el (c-safe-scan-lists): Check `limit' is present and
	not identically nil before generating a narrow-to-region call.  Generate code
	to check `limit' is not nil at run time.
	(c-go-list-forward, c-go-list-backward): Remove the generation of redundant
	narrow-to-region, instead calling c-safe-scan-lists directly.
	(c-go-up-list-forward, c-go-up-list-backward, c-go-down-list-forward)
	(c-go-down-list-backward): Invoke the corresponding macros without the "go-"
	to determine the destination position instead of generating a redundant
	narrow-to-region.

2016-08-19  Robert Cochran  <robert-git@cochranmail.com>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/map.el (map--dispatch): Fix docstring

	parameter that has been renamed since the docstring was written. Fix
	both errors, fixing (Bug#24182).

2016-08-19  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Amend hack-local-variables-prop-line not always to return any mode on line 1.

	This fixes bug #24266.

	* lisp/files.el (hack-local-variables-prop-line): Change the name of the
	parameter mode-only to handle-mode.  Change its meaning, such that it being
	set to a value non-nil and not t removes any mode parameter from the result
	list.  Leave its values nil and t with the same meanings they had.
	(hack-local-variables): Call hack-local-variables-prop-line appropriately.

2016-08-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Minor text-quoting-style fixes

	* lisp/cus-edit.el (custom-buffer-create-internal):
	* lisp/recentf.el (recentf-edit-list):
	Follow text-quoting-style preference when quoting in UI strings.
	* src/doc.c (Fsubstitute_command_keys): Don’t say that curved
	quotes are substituted for, as this is no longer true.

2016-08-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix substitute-command-keys unibyte, alloc bugs

	* src/doc.c (Fsubstitute_command_keys): Fix some problems with
	unibyte strings and with buffer allocation.  Make strings
	multibyte, to avoid problems with unibyte strings that are not
	valid UTF-8 (Bug#24206).  Redo buffer allocation so that it is
	O(N), not O(N**2).  Avoid going past the end of the input string
	when given invalid input.  Avoid some unlikely problems in
	accessing the wrong storage after a GC.

2016-08-13  Joakim Jalap  <joakim.jalap@fastmail.com>

	Fix "C-u" when an input method is active

	* lisp/international/quail.el (quail-input-method): Defer to the
	input method iff 'overriding-terminal-local-map' is
	'universal-argument-map' and the given key has no binding there.
	(Bug#22958)

2016-08-13  Martin Rudalics  <rudalics@gmx.at>

	Fix docs on `display-buffer-below-selected' (Bug#24213)

	* lisp/window.el (display-buffer-below-selected): Fix
	doc-string (Bug#24213).
	* doc/lispref/windows.texi (Display Action Functions): Fix
	documentation of `display-buffer-below-selected'.

2016-08-12  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	cl-fill: Rename arguments to cl-seq and cl-item

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-seq.el (cl-fill):
	Rename arguments to 'cl-seq' and 'cl-item' as elsewhere.

2016-08-12  Thomas Fitzsimmons  <fitzsim@fitzsim.org>

	Fix display.texi typo

	* doc/lispref/display.texi (Faces): Fix typo.

2016-08-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix process leak with make-network-process

	This problem was introduced by the recent async changes (Bug#23808).
	* src/process.c (Fmake_process): Move USE_SAFE_ALLOCA later,
	so that it follows the start_process_unwind unwind-protect.
	Set pid to -1 while the process is being created.
	(start_process_unwind): Omit unnecessary emacs_abort test.
	(connect_network_socket): Simplify use of counts.  Unwind
	bind_polling_period a bit earlier, so that a remove_process
	unwind-protect can be added when needed; this is the heart of
	the fix.  Undo the unwind-protect just before returning.

2016-08-11  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Avoid annoying re-scroll when buffer has many overlay strings

	* src/xdisp.c (redisplay_window): Add better recovery from a
	situation where window-start is on buffer position which has a
	before-string that includes newlines, with the result that point
	is not visible in the window, because the display engine starts
	displaying with the before-string.  (Bug#24179)

2016-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Omit unnecessary process initialization

	* src/process.c (make_process, Fmake_process)
	(Fmake_pipe_process, Fmake_serial_process)
	(Fmake_network_process, server_accept_connection):
	Omit unnecessary initialization of already-cleared storage.

2016-08-10  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	cl-delete-duplicates: Parse :if to have cl-if bound

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-seq.el (cl--delete-duplicates):
	We need also to parse keyword :if, otherwise cl-if
	is unbound.
	This reverts commit:
	68fdbeb917b80e29e0b15506f18f7ed41d8ffdfd

2016-08-10  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	cl-delete-duplicates: do not parse :if keyword

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-seq.el (cl--delete-duplicates):
	Parse only the supported keywords.

2016-08-10  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Add compatibility layer for `temporary-file-directory-function'

	* lisp/net/tramp-compat.el
	(tramp-compat-temporary-file-directory-function): New defalias.

	* lisp/net/tramp.el (tramp-handle-make-nearby-temp-file): Use it.

	* test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el (tramp-test32-make-nearby-temp-file):
	Skip for older Emacs versions.

2016-08-10  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* lisp/comint.el (comint-password-prompt-regexp): Add "PEM" for OpenVPN.

	(Bug#24059)

2016-08-10  Vincent Belaïche  <vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net>

	Handle nil cell value in compiled printer functions.

	* doc/misc/ses.texi (Quick Tutorial): Minor clarification about the
	ses-range `!' modifier.
	(More on cell printing): Fix this that the fallback printer is
	`ses-prin1', not "%S".  That makes a difference for any cell value for
	which "%S" would insert a backslash characters.

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-local-printer-compile): Handle the nil cell value
	--- contrary to emacs-25 branches ses-call-printer does not handle
	prior to calling a function printer.  Not doing this would still work
	because the compiled function would throw and error and SES would in
	the end resort to the ses-prin1 fallback, however this way would not
	be in line with the raison d'être of compiling printer which is speed.

2016-08-09  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Turn on lexical-binding in json.el

	Measuring with (benchmark-run 100 (json-read-file "foobar.json"))
	showed 12-31% reduction in execution time.
	* lisp/json.el: Turn on lexical-binding.

2016-08-09  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Nudge WoMan toward lexical-binding

	* lisp/woman.el (woman-parse-man.conf, woman-manpath-add-locales):
	Use cl-pushnew instead of add-to-list.
	(woman-justify-list): Rename to woman-justify-styles.
	(woman-justify-styles): New array.
	(woman-justify, woman-decode-region, woman2-ad, woman2-na): Use it.
	(woman-cached-data): Use cl-pushnew instead of add-to-list.

2016-08-09  Vincent Belaïche  <vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net>

	Apply changes from commits 3c97b0f758 and 8a38e948b0 to master branch.

	Here follows the logs from the two commits which I apply to master.

	commit 3c97b0f7589e06aeb1ab0147f0ee32974c32926d
	Author: Vincent Belaïche <vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net>
	Date:   Fri Jul 29 13:44:14 2016 +0200

	Fix ses-delete-blanks to delete only blanks + documentation.

	* doc/misc/ses.texi (Quick Tutorial): Mention the '!'
	'ses-range' modifier as an alternative to 'ses+'.
	(Advanced Features): Add a refernce to node 'Nonrelocatable
	references' concerning function 'ses-rename-cell'.
	(Standard formula functions): Mention the '!' 'ses-range'
	modifier as an alternative to 'ses-delete-blanks'.
	(More on cell printing): Fix fallback printer
	definition.  Minor editorial formatting changes.
	(Nonrelocatable references): Document the use of
	'ses-rename-cell' as a better way to make cell reference
	non-relocatable.
	(The data area): Document the presence of local printer
	definitions in the data area.

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-delete-blanks): Do not remove
	*error*.  Any error in an argument should propagate into the
	using formula rather than being silently hidden !

	commit 8a38e948b039516e70176ebe20c5349e2ade6ac5
	Author: Vincent Belaïche <vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net>
	Date:   Thu Jul 28 19:49:37 2016 +0200

	Fix local printer set to left aligned string formatter.

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-local-printer-compile): Add missing case
	for left-aligned string formatter.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* .dir-locals.el (c-noise-macro-names): Remove NONVOLATILE.

2016-08-09  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv.el: Fix λ-lifting in the presence of shadowing

	Change the code which detects and circumvents the case where one of the
	variables used in λ-lifting is shadowed, so that it also works when the
	shadowing comes before the λ-lifted function (bug#24171).

	(cconv--remap-llv): New function, extracted from cconv-convert.
	(cconv-convert): Use it, but differently for `let' and `let*'.

2016-08-09  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	CC Mode: check for and fix missing call to before_change_functions.

	Fixes bug #24094 and bug #24074.

	This can happen with `revert-buffer' or sometimes `find-file', when the file
	is already in a buffer, but the file has been changed outside of Emacs.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-mode.el (c-after-change): When we detect a missing
	invocation of c-before-change-functions, we assume the changed region is the
	entire buffer, and call c-before-change explicitly before proceding.

2016-08-09  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Make c-deprepertize-CPP work on deletion/insertion of "s.  Fixes bug #24132.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-mode.el (c-depropertize-CPP): Rewrite function.

2016-08-09  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Support $ENV in Tramp

	* doc/misc/tramp.texi (Remote processes): Explain setting $ENV.

	* etc/NEWS: Explain the "ENV" environment variable in
	`tramp-remote-process-environment'.

	* lisp/net/tramp-sh.el (tramp-remote-process-environment): Add "ENV=''".
	(tramp-open-shell): Read $ENV value from
	`tramp-remote-process-environment'.
	(tramp-open-connection-setup-interactive-shell): Set values in
	proper order.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify exec_byte_code via moving decls etc.

	* src/bytecode.c (exec_byte_code): Simplify, mostly by moving
	initializers into decls, and by omitting some unnecessary
	changes to ‘top’.  This improves performance a bit on x86-64,
	as it happens.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove interpreter’s byte stack

	This improves performance overall on my benchmark on x86-64,
	since the interpreted program-counter resides in a machine
	register rather than in RAM.
	* etc/DEBUG, src/.gdbinit: Remove xbytecode GDB command, as there
	is no longer a byte stack to decode.
	* src/bytecode.c (struct byte_stack, byte_stack_list)
	(relocate_byte_stack): Remove.  All uses removed.
	(FETCH): Simplify now that pc is now local (typically, in a
	register) and no longer needs to be relocated.
	(CHECK_RANGE): Remove.  All uses now done inline, in a different way.
	(BYTE_CODE_QUIT): Remove; now done by op_relative_branch.
	(exec_byte_code): Allocate a copy of the function’s bytecode,
	so that there is no problem if GC moves it.
	* src/lisp.h (struct handler): Remove byte_stack member.
	All uses removed.
	(SAFE_ALLOCA_LISP_EXTRA): New macro, a generalization of
	SAFE_ALLOCA_LISP.
	(SAFE_ALLOCA_LISP): Use it.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove arbitrary limit on bytecode maxdepth

	* src/bytecode.c (exec_byte_code): Remove MAX_ALLOCA-based limit
	on bytecode maxdepth, by using SAFE_ALLOCA_LISP instead of alloca.

	pipeline is fuller.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Tune bytecode quitting

	* src/bytecode.c (BYTE_CODE_QUIT): Check for GC, too.  Do the
	check only once every 256 times.  This should be good enough, and
	improves performance significantly on x86-64 as branch-prediction
	typically assumes checking will not be done so the instruction
	pipeline stays fuller.
	(exec_byte_code): Set up the quit counter.  Don’t call maybe_gc
	directly, as BYTE_CODE_QUIT does that now.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify BYTE_CODE_SAFE checking

	* src/bytecode.c (BYTE_CODE_SAFE): Default to false, so that it
	can be used outside #if.  All uses of ‘defined BYTE_CODE_SAFE’
	changed to ‘BYTE_CODE_SAFE’.  Use BYTE_CODE_SAFE in plain
	expressions instead of #if expressions when this is easy.
	(struct byte_stack) [BYTE_CODE_SAFE]: Remove member ‘bottom’,
	as it is no longer needed.
	(exec_byte_code): Omit #if BYTE_CODE_SAFE when this is easy.
	Simplify stack-overflow checking when BYTE_CODE_SAFE.

2016-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Get BYTE_CODE_METER working again

	BYTE_CODE_METER hasn’t worked since 2013, and nobody seems to have
	noticed.  Perhaps we should remove it?
	* src/bytecode.c (METER_2) [BYTE_CODE_METER]:
	Use *aref_addr instead of AREF, since it needs to be an lvalue.

2016-08-08  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix cursor position under scroll-conservatively and overlay strings

	* src/xdisp.c (try_scrolling): Handle the case where the last
	visible screen line of a window displays a before- or after-string
	that takes up the whole screen line, and therefore there's no
	place to display the cursor, even though the window does seem to
	include the position of point.  (Bug#24179)

2016-08-08  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* lisp/files.el (file-ownership-preserved-p): Fix docstring.  (Bug#23998)

2016-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Tune interpretation of integer arglist descriptor

	* src/bytecode.c (exec_byte_code):
	Simplify and tune when INTEGERP (args_template).

2016-08-07  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix debugging of string-match-p errors

	* src/eval.c (call_debugger): Bind inhibit-changing-match-data to nil so
	that debugger code that needs to do regexp match won't break
	(Bug #23949, Bug #24166, Bug#16294).

2016-08-07  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Add `make-nearby-temp-file' and `temporary-file-directory'

	* doc/lispref/files.texi (Unique File Names):
	Introduce `make-nearby-temp-file' and `temporary-file-directory'.
	(Magic File Names): Mention `make-nearby-temp-file' and

2016-08-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Make sh-mode always use p-s-lookup-properties

	This lets functions which rely on syntax-propertize for parsing
	work correctly even before font lock has a chance to run.

	* lisp/progmodes/sh-script.el (sh-set-shell): Set
	parse-sexp-lookup-properties unconditionally (Bug #4920).

2016-08-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix cl-assert with atomp FORM, non-nil SHOW-ARGS

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-macs.el (cl-assert): Don't require that FORM is a
	list when showing its (non-existent) arguments (Bug #18587).

2016-08-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Don't delete selection after indent-rigidly

	* lisp/indent.el (indent-rigidly): Pass `deactivate-mark' as the ON-EXIT
	function to `set-transient-map', this prevents `delete-selection-mode'
	from deleting the text that was just indented (Bug #20408).

2016-08-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix byte-compile of interactive closures

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el (byte-compile--reify-function): Put
	bindings after docstring and `interactive' form, if any (Bug #24122).

2016-08-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

2016-08-06  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Fix quoted lambda warning from lexical-let

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl.el (cl--function-convert): Quote the inner lambda

	* lisp/vc/emerge.el (emerge-metachars): Obsolete.
	(emerge-protect-metachars): Delete.
	(emerge-make-diff-list, emerge-make-diff3-list): Replace all calls to

	quoting is done the same on all system types (Bug #6136).  Also shell
	quote `emerge-diff-program' and `emerge-diff3-program'.

	Fix accessing regex-resources in out-of-tree test runs in regex-tests

	[82a487d: Fix reading of regex-resources in regex-tests] attempted to
	fix regex-tests failing when run from the source tree (i.e. via make)
	by hard-coding path to regex-resources directory relative to the test
	directory.

	This fixed runs from the tree but broke the test when run using other
	methods.

	Fix by trying ‘load-file-name’ or ‘buffer-file-name’, whichever is set.

	* test/src/regex-tests.el (regex-tests--resources-dir): New variable
	storing path to the regex-resources directory.
	(regex-tests-generic-line): Use aforementioned variable.

	New function.
	(emacs_gnutls_handshake) [!WINDOWSNT]:
	Use it as the errno function, if non-blocking.

	* src/gnutls.c (init_gnutls_functions, emacs_gnutls_handshake)
	[WINDOWSNT]: Don’t bother with gnutls_check_version or
	gnutls_transport_set_lowat, as they are no longer needed now that
	we require gnutls 2.12.2 or later.

	variable.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	     #define STREQ(s1, s2) ((strcmp (s1, s2) == 0))
	     ^

	* src/regex.c (STREQ): Remove unused macro.  It should have been removed
	in a [4538a5e: Refactor regex character class parsing in [:name:]]
	commit but was mistakenly left out.

2016-08-02  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-generic.el: Fix problems introduced by new

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-generic.el (cl--generic-load-hist-format): New function.
	(cl-generic-define-method, cl--generic-describe): Use it.
	(cl--generic-search-method): Adjust for new format.

	* lisp/progmodes/elisp-mode.el (elisp--xref-find-definitions):
	* test/lisp/progmodes/elisp-mode-tests.el:
	Use cl--generic-load-hist-format rather than hard-coding cl-generic's
	internal format.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Hardcode regex syntax to remove dead code handling different syntax

	Emacs only ever uses its own regex syntax so support for other syntaxes
	is never used.  Hardcode the syntax so that the compilar can detect such
	dead code and remove it from compiled code.

	The only exception is RE_NO_POSIX_BACKTRACKING which can be separatelly
	specified.  Handle this separatelly with a function argument (replacing
	now unnecessary syntax argument).

	With this patchset, size of Emacs binary on x86_64 machine is reduced by
	around 60 kB:

		new-sizes:-rwx------ 3 mpn eng 30254720 Jul 27 23:31 src/emacs
		old-sizes:-rwx------ 3 mpn eng 30314828 Jul 27 23:29 src/emacs

	* src/regex.h (re_pattern_buffer): Don’t define syntax field #ifdef emacs.
	(re_compile_pattern): Replace syntax with posix_backtracking argument.

	* src/regex.c (print_compiled_pattern): Don’t print syntax #ifdef emacs.
	(regex_compile): #ifdef emacs, replace syntax argument with
	posix_backtracking which is now used instead of testing for
	RE_NO_POSIX_BACKTRACKING syntax.
	(re_match_2_internal): Don’t access bufp->syntax #ifndef emacs.
	(re_compile_pattern): Replace syntax with posix_backtracking argument.

	* src/search.c (compile_pattern_1): Pass boolean posix_backtracking
	instead of syntax to re_compile_pattern.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Get rid of re_set_whitespace_regexp

	* src/regex.h (re_set_whitespace_regexp): Delete.
	(re_compile_pattern): Add whitespace_regexp argument #ifdef emacs.

	* src/regex.c (re_set_whitespace_regexp, whitespace_regexp): Delete.
	(regex_compile): Add whitespace_regexp argument #ifdef emacs and wrap
	whitespace_regexp-related code in an #ifdef emacs so it’s compiled out
	unless building Emacs.
	(re_compile_pattern): Pass whitespace_regexp argument to regex_compile

	* src/search.c (compile_pattern_1): Don’t use re_set_whitespace_regexp,
	pass the regex as argument to re_compile_pattern instead.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Get rid of re_set_syntax

	Instead of using a global variable for storing regex syntax, pass it
	to re_compile_pattern.  This is only enabled when compiling Emacs (i.e.
	‘#ifdef emacs’).

	* src/regex.h (re_set_syntax): Declare only #ifndef emacs.
	(re_compile_pattern): Now takes syntax argument #ifdef emacs.

	* src/regex.c (re_syntax_options): Define only #ifndef emacs.
	(re_compile_pattern): Use the new syntax argument #ifdef emacs.

	* src/search.c (compile_pattern_1): Don’t use re_set_syntax and
	instead pass syntax to re_compile_pattern directly.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Remove dead opcodes in regex bytecode

	There is no way to specify before_dot and after_dot opcodes in a regex
	so code handling those ends up being dead.  Remove it.

	* src/regex.c (print_partial_compiled_pattern, regex_compile,
	analyze_first, re_match_2_internal): Remove handling and references to
	before_dot and after_dot opcodes.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Refactor regex character class parsing in [:name:]

	re_wctype function is used in three separate places and in all of
	those places almost exact code extracting the name from [:name:]
	surrounds it.  Furthermore, re_wctype requires a NUL-terminated
	string, so the name of the character class is copied to a temporary
	buffer.

	The code duplication and unnecessary memory copying can be avoided by
	pushing the responsibility of parsing the whole [:name:] sequence to
	the function.

	Furthermore, since now the function has access to the length of the
	character class name (since it’s doing the parsing), it can take
	advantage of that information in skipping some string comparisons and
	using a constant-length memcmp instead of strcmp which needs to take
	care of NUL bytes.

	* src/regex.c (re_wctype): Delete function.  Replace it with:
	(re_wctype_parse): New function which parses a whole [:name:] string
	and returns a RECC_* constant or -1 if the string is not of [:name:]
	format.
	(regex_compile): Use re_wctype_parse.
	* src/syntax.c (skip_chars): Use re_wctype_parse.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Split regex glibc test cases into separet tests

	* test/src/regex-tests.el (regex-tests): Remove and split into multiple
	tests cases.
	(regex-tests-glbic-BOOST, regex-tests-glibc-PCRE,
	regex-tests-glibc-PTESTS, regex-tests-glibc-TESTS): New test cases split
	from ‘regex-tests’.

2016-08-02  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Fix reading of regex-resources in regex-tests

	* test/src/regex-tests.el (regex-tests-generic-line): Referring to
	‘buffer-file-name’ does not work when running the test from command
	line, i.e. via make, which results in (wrong-type-argument stringp nil)
	failures.  Replace it with hard-coded path.
	(regex-tests-BOOST, regex-tests-PCRE, regex-tests-PTESTS-whitelist,
	regex-tests-TESTS-whitelist): ‘regex-tests-generic-line’ now  includes
	the ‘regex-resources’ path component so the tests don’t need to specify
	it explicitly.

2016-08-02  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	Fix ‘[[:cc:]]*literal’ regex failing to match ‘literal’ (bug#24020)

	The regex engine tries to optimise Kleene star by avoiding backtracking
	when it can detect that star’s operand cannot match what follows it in
	the pattern.

	For example, when ‘[[:alpha:]]*1’ tries to match a ‘foo’, the engine
	will test the longest match for ‘[[:alpha:]]*’, namely ’foo’ which is
	the entire string.  Literal digit one still present in the pattern will
	however not match the remaining empty string.

	Normally, backtracking would be performed trying a shorter match for the
	character class (namely ‘fo’ leaving ‘o’ in the string), but since the
	engine knows whatever would be put back into the string cannot possibly
	match literal digit one so no backtracking will be attempted.

	In the regexes of the form ‘[[:CC:]]*X’, the optimisation can be applied
	if the character class CC does not match character X.  In the above
	example, this holds because digit one is not in alpha character class.

	This test is performed by mutually_exclusive_p function but it did not
	check class bits of a charset opcode.  This resulted in an assumption
	that character classes do not match multibyte characters.  For example,
	it would incorrectly conclude that [[:alpha:]] doesn’t match ‘ż’.

	This, in turn, led to the aforementioned Kleene star optimisation being
	incorrectly applied in patterns such as ‘[[:graph:]]*☠’ (which should
	match ‘☠’ but doesn’t as can be tested by executing
	    (string-match-p "[[:graph:]]*☠" "☠")
	which should return 0 but instead yields nil.

	This issue affects any class witch matches multibyte characters, i.e.
	if ‘[[:cc:]]’ matches a multibyte character X then ‘[[:cc:]]*X’ will
	fail to match ‘X’.

	* src/regex.c (executing_charset): A new function for executing the
	charset and charset_not opcodes.  It performs check on the character
	taking into consideration existing bitmap, range table and class bits.
	It also advances the pointer in the regex bytecode past the parsed
	opcode.
	(CHARSET_LOOKUP_RANGE_TABLE_RAW, CHARSET_LOOKUP_RANGE_TABLE): Removed.
	Code now included in executing_charset.
	(mutually_exclusive_p, re_match_2_internal): Changed to take advantage
	of executing_charset function.

	* test/src/regex-tests.el: New file with tests for the character class
	matching.

	‘signal’ no longer returns

	Although for decades ‘signal’ has been documented to not return,
	a corner case in the Lisp debugger causes ‘signal’ to return.
	Remove the corner case and adjust Emacs internals accordingly.
	An alternative would be to document the corner case, but this
	would complicate the Lisp API unnecessarily.  (Bug#24047)
	* src/eval.c (signal_or_quit): New function, with most of the
	old contents of Fsignal.
	(quit): New function, which uses signal_or_quit and which
	might return.  All keyboard-based callers of Fsignal (Qquit,
	Qnil) changed to use this new function instead.
	(Fsignal): Use signal_or_quit.  Now _Noreturn.  All callers
	changed.
	(xsignal): Move to lisp.h.
	* src/lisp.h (xsignal): Now an inline function, as it's now
	just an alias for Fsignal.

	Don’t create unnecessary marker in ‘delete-trailing-whitespace’

	* lisp/simple.el (delete-trailing-whitespace): If END argument is nil,
	there is no need for the end-marker to be created.

2016-07-04  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Simplify ‘delete-trailing-whitespace’ by not treating \n as whitespace

	* lisp/simple.el (delete-trailing-whitespace): Set newline’s character
	syntax to non-whitespace so that ‘\s-’ regular expression does not match
	it.

	This simplifies the loop slightly since a simple ‘\s-+$’ can be used and
	as a consequence ‘line-beginning-position’ function does not need to be
	called any longer.

	Furthermore, when newline has whitespace syntax, ‘\s-$’ regular
	expression ends up matching empty lins since ‘\s-’ matches newline
	characetr of proceeding line.  This leads to needless loop iterations.

	Since previous change to ‘delete-trailing-whitespace’ already introduced
	‘with-syntax-table’, take advantage of it and also overwrite newline’s
	character syntax.

2016-07-04  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	Make ‘delete-trailing-whitespace’ delete spaces after form feed

	* lisp/simple.el (delete-trailing-whitespace): Treat form fead as
	a non-whitespace character (regradless of whether it’s character syntax
	is whitespace) and delete any whitespace following it instead of leaving
	lines with form feeds completely unchanged.  I.e. a line like "\f " will
	now became "\f".

	* src/buffer.c (set-buffer-major-mode): Run `fundamental-mode' when the buffer
	gets set to that mode, so that `run-mode-hooks', and thus
	`hack-local-variables' get run.

2016-06-24  Tino Calancha  <tino.calancha@gmail.com>

	Remove two uses of 'min' in Fwindow_text_pixel_size

	it calls move_it_to twice.  Suggested by Eli Zaretskii.

2016-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Clarify intent of FACE_FROM_ID and IMAGE_FROM_ID

	* src/dispextern.h (FACE_OPT_FROM_ID): Don’t use FACE_FROM_ID,
	since it is intended to be used only when it returns a non-null
	pointer, and here the pointer might be null.
	(IMAGE_OPT_FROM_ID): Don’t use IMAGE_FROM_ID, for similar reasons.

2016-06-23  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

2016-06-23  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* lisp/international/characters.el (standard-case-table): Improve last change.

2016-06-23  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Improve results of 'upcase' for characters with title-case

	* lisp/international/characters.el (standard-case-table): Swap the
	order of some lines, to have 'upcase' return the upper-case
	variant, not the title-case, for some characters whose lower-case
	map to the same codepoints.  (Bug#23833)

2016-06-23  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Make typing into incomplete C++ raw strings work, and make it work fast enough

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-macro, c-state-pp-to-literal):
	Put `save-match-data' around calls to `looking-at' to enable the use of the
	match data in higher level functions.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations)

2016-06-22  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Update Unicode data files from Unicode 9.0.0

	* admin/unidata/copyright.html:
	* admin/unidata/BidiBrackets.txt:
	* admin/unidata/UnicodeData.txt: Update from Unicode 9.0.0, just
	released.

2016-06-22  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix test for whether the '.el' file is newer than '.elc'

	* src/lread.c (Fload): Don't overwrite the last character of the
	file name in FOUND with 'c', unless the file name ended in ".elc"
	to begin with.  Don't treat empty files as byte-compiled.  See
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-06/msg00463.html
	for more details of the problem this caused.

2016-06-22  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix 'insert-file-contents' when REPLACE is non-nil

	* src/fileio.c (maybe_move_gap): New function to move the gap to
	the end of a buffer, if it isn't there already.
	(Finsert_file_contents): Call 'maybe_move_gap' before using
	conversion_buffer's text as a C 'char' array.  (Bug#23659)
	* src/coding.c (decode_eol): Compute the byte increment before

	Avoid compiler warning

	* src/w32fns.c (Fx_show_tip): Don’t jump over auto initialization.

2016-06-22  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	Fix last change to FRAME_INTERNAL_BORDER_WIDTH

	* src/w32fns.c (x_set_internal_border_width): Don’t use
	FRAME_INTERNAL_BORDER_WIDTH(), which is now a function call, as an
	lvalue.

2016-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve --without-x GCC pacification

	* src/composite.c (autocmp_chars):
	* src/conf_post.h (DebPrint) [HAVE_NTGUI && !DebPrint && !EMACSDEBUG]:
	Use simpler ((void) 0) for no-op expression returning void.
	* src/dispextern.h [HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM]:
	Include fontset.h, for face_for_char.
	(FACE_SUITABLE_FOR_ASCII_CHAR_P, FACE_FOR_CHAR):
	Now inline functions instead of macros.  This avoids the need for
	all those casts to void.
	(FACE_SUITABLE_FOR_ASCII_CHAR_P): Omit 2nd (unused) arg.
	All uses changed.
	* src/frame.c (Ficonify_frame, Fset_frame_position):

	* src/xdisp.c (note_mode_line_or_margin_highlight)
	(note_mouse_highlight):
	Assume HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM for simplicity, since the code should
	now work either way without generating warnings.
	* src/frame.c (display_available) [HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM]: New function.
	(window_system_available) [HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM]: Move to frame.h.
	(decode_window_system_frame): Use check_window_system instead of
	rolling the code ourself.  Return needed only if HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM.
	(decode_window_system_frame, check_window_system):
	Merge the HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM and !HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM versions into one.
	* src/frame.c (Ficonify_frame, Fset_frame_position):
	* src/xdisp.c (show_mouse_face, define_frame_cursor1)
	(note_mouse_highlight):
	Narrow the scope of the HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM #ifdef;
	this is a better way to pacify GCC.
	* src/xdisp.c (x_set_left_fringe, x_set_right_fringe)
	(x_set_right_divider_width, x_set_bottom_divider_width):
	* src/xfns.c (x_set_internal_border_width):
	Don’t use what are now function calls as lvalues.
	* src/frame.h (WINDOW_SYSTEM_RETURN): New macro.
	(decode_window_system_frame, check_window_system):
	Use it, to avoid the need for duplicate declarations.
	(window_system_available): Now an inline function.
	(display_available): New decl.
	(frame_dimension): New inline function.
	(FRAME_FRINGE_COLS, FRAME_LEFT_FRINGE_WIDTH)
	(FRAME_RIGHT_FRINGE_WIDTH, FRAME_TOTAL_FRINGE_WIDTH)
	(FRAME_INTERNAL_BORDER_WIDTH, FRAME_RIGHT_DIVIDER_WIDTH)
	(FRAME_BOTTOM_DIVIDER_WIDTH):
	Use it, to avoid the need for duplicate definitions.
	Now inline functions instead of macros.
	* src/gnutls.c (gnutls_log_function2i): Remove.
	* src/gnutls.h (GNUTLS_LOG2i): Use ‘message’ directly.
	This avoids complaints about gnutls_log_function2i being defined
	and not used on older platforms that do not need to call GNUTLS_LOG2i.
	* src/image.c (DefaultDepthOfScreen) [0]: Remove unused macro.
	* src/lisp.h (AUTO_STRING_WITH_LEN): Revert change from ‘type id =
	expr’ to ‘type id; id = expr’, as this would suppress valid
	jump-misses-init diagnostics.  Let’s find a better way to address
	the problem.
	* src/vm-limit.c (__MALLOC_HOOK_VOLATILE):
	Define only if needed.
	* src/xdisp.c (handle_single_display_spec):
	Simplify fringe_bitmap computation.
	(define_frame_cursor1): Do nothing unless in a window system.
	All callers changed and simplified.
	* src/xfaces.c (realize_default_face):
	Use a simpler way to pacify GCC when a return value is not used
	on some platforms.

2016-06-21  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@russet.org.uk>

	Ensure undo-boundary after all commands

	* lisp/simple.el (undo-auto--boundaries): Ensure an undo-boundary after
	  every command whether it (apparently) changes the buffer or not.

	See Bug#23785 for discussion.

2016-06-21  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix vertical layout calculations when newline has line-height property

	* src/xdisp.c (move_it_in_display_line_to): Reset the iterator's
	'constrain_row_ascent_descent_p' flag after processing the
	newline, similar to what 'display_line' does.  Without this, the
	flag remains set once set by x_produce_glyphs, and causes the
	vertical layout calculations to go awry, because Emacs thinks the
	screen lines have zero height.	(Bug#23850)

2016-06-20  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	Fix compiler warnings in Cygwin-w32 build

	* src/conf_post.h (DebPrint) [!EMACSDEBUG]: Add empty do-while

	(w32_strerror): Use format specifier %d for sprintf argument of
	type int.
	(emacs_abort): Cast sprintf argument of type DWORD to unsigned
	int, and use format specifier %x, for compatibility with Cygwin.
	(unicode_append_menu) [NTGUI_UNICODE]:
	* src/w32menu.c [NTGUI_UNICODE] (get_menu_item_info)
	(set_menu_item_info, unicode_append_menu)
	(unicode_message_box):
	* src/menu.c [NTGUI_UNICODE] (unicode_append_menu): Define as
	functions rather than macros to avoid "address will always
	evaluate as true" compiler warnings.

	* src/w32font.c (w32_to_x_charset): Use format specifier %d for
	sprintf argument of type int.

	* src/w32term.c (x_draw_glyphless_glyph_string_foreground): Cast
	sprintf argument of type int to unsigned int to match %X format
	specifier.
	(w32_scroll_bar_handle_click):
	(w32_horizontal_scroll_bar_handle_click): Declare 'f'.

	* src/w32term.h (FRAME_DISPLAY_INFO): Explicitly discard unused
	argument.

	first set, and only if HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM.

	* src/frame.c [!HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM] (decode_window_system_frame):
	Define _Noreturn version to avoid "suggest attribute noreturn"
	compiler warning.
	(check_window_system): Declare as _Noreturn.
	(Ficonify_frame):
	(Fset_frame_position): Don’t declare and set 'f'.

	* src/frame.h [!HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM] (decode_window_system_frame)
	(check_window_system):  Add _Noreturn prototypes.
	(FRAME_FRINGE_COLS, FRAME_TOTAL_FRINGE_WIDTH)
	(FRAME_LEFT_FRINGE_WIDTH, FRAME_RIGHT_FRINGE_WIDTH)

	(file-notify-test07-backup)
	(file-notify-test08-watched-file-in-watched-dir): Make test

	* src/alloc.c (ABLOCKS_BUSY): Rename arg to avoid potential clash
	with member ‘abase’ in definiens.
	(lisp_align_malloc, lisp_align_free): Use bool for boolean.

	(map-merge-with): Same, plus use `cl-callf' to try and avoid performing
	3 lookups per inner iteration.

2016-06-16  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	Fix ifdef-vs-if typo with RANDR13_LIBRARY

	* src/xfns.c (x_get_monitor_attributes_xrandr): Use #if, not #ifdef.
	This ports to systems that predate xrandr 1.3. See Christian Lynbech in:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-06/msg00198.html

2016-06-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port to platforms where char * has top bit set

	This fixes a five-year-old FIXME comment.  Although I don’t know
	of a platform where this is a problem in practice, better safe
	than sorry.
	* src/doc.c (Fdocumentation): If SUBRP, simply use doc as integer,
	as it is now an integer, not char *.
	(store_function_docstring): Offset is now EMACS_INT, not ptrdiff_t;
	this is a file offset and EMACS_INT is better if --with-wide-int.
	If SUBRP, simply store the offset rather than negating it and
	converting it to char *.
	* src/lisp.h (struct Lisp_Subr.doc): Now EMACS_INT, not char *.

2016-06-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove system-specific -I switch from Cygwin-w32 build

	Suggested by Eli Zaretskii in discussion of bug#18302.

	* src/image.c [HAVE_NTGUI]: Remove the unused macro
	PIXEL_ALREADY_TYPEDEFED.  On Cygwin, include "noX/xpm.h" instead of
	"X11/xpm.h".

	* configure.ac [CYGWIN && HAVE_W32]: Change the xpm test to use
	"noX/xpm.h".  Don't add a -I switch to CPPFLAGS.

2016-06-14  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@gmail.com>

	Make python.el work in Emacs 24

	* lisp/progmodes/python.el: Bump version.
	(python-define-auxiliary-skeleton): Only use format-message if
	fbound (Bug#23126).

2016-06-13  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	'type_CtrlAlt'.

2016-06-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Call tzset after setting TZ

	* src/editfns.c (tzlookup): Call tzset after setting TZ, so that
	the setting change propagates into Emacs local time (Bug#23600).
	(emacs_setenv_TZ): Clarify comments.

2016-06-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Update texinfo.tex

	* doc/misc/texinfo.tex: Update from gnulib.

2016-06-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	New macro GNUC_PREREQ for GCC version

	* src/conf_post.h (GNUC_PREREQ): New macro.
	Change uses of __GNUC_MINOR__ and __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ to use this
	macro instead, for clarity and consistency.
	(PRINTF_ARCHETYPE): New macro.  Define it to __gnu_printf__ only
	if glibc, since non-GNU platforms don’t necessarily support GNU
	printf formats.
	(ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT_PRINTF): Use it.

2016-06-12  Nicolas Petton  <nicolas@petton.fr>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el (seq-drop): Better list implementation

2016-06-12  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Fix printf-related compilation warnings on MinGW

	* src/conf_post.h (ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT_PRINTF) [__MINGW32__]: Use
	'__ms_printf__', not '__gnu_printf__', as the latter is not what
	MS 'printf' supports, and causes bogus compilation warnings.
	* src/lisp.h (pI) [__MINGW32__]: Define to "I64", as MS 'printf'
	doesn't support the "ll" modifier.

2016-06-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	emacs_strerror cleanups

	* src/buffer.c, src/emacs.c, src/lread.c: Don’t include coding.h;
	no longer needed, now that emacs_strerror is declared by lisp.h.
	* src/coding.c (emacs_strerror): Remove; moved to emacs.c.
	* src/coding.h (emacs_strerror) [emacs]: Remove decl; moved
	to lisp.h.
	* src/emacs.c (emacs_strerror): Move here from coding.c.  Do not
	convert result string; this is now the caller’s responsibility,
	as some need conversion and others don’t.
	* src/fileio.c (report_file_errno, report_file_notify_error):
	Use emacs_strerror rather than rolling it ourselves.
	* src/lisp.h (emacs_strerror): Move decl here from coding.h.
	* src/lread.c (dir_warning): Just call emacs_strerror rather than
	both strerror and emacs_strerror.  Convert its result from
	locale-coding-system, since it no longer does that conversion.
	* src/sound.c (sound_perror):
	* src/sysdep.c (emacs_perror, str_collate):
	Use emacs_strerror, not strerror.

2016-06-10  David Reitter  <david.reitter@gmail.com>

	Prevent compiler warning for unused arguments

	* lisp/international/ucs-normalize.el
	(ucs-normalize-hfs-nfd-pre-write-conversion):
	Prevent compiler warning for unused arguments, add coment.

2016-06-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Catch malloc_get_state, malloc_set_state failure

	This should help insulate Emacs better from configuration screwups.
	Future versions of the GNU C library are planned to deprecate
	these functions, but will continue to support them in
	already-built-and-dumped Emacs executables.
	* src/alloc.c (malloc_initialize_hook) [DOUG_LEA_MALLOC]:
	Abort if malloc_set_state fails.
	(alloc_unexec_pre) [DOUG_LEA_MALLOC]:
	Report malloc_get_state failure, and exit.

2016-06-10  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	Show returned value after gdb-mi "finish" command

	* lisp/progmodes/gdb-mi.el (gdb-stopped): Display the expected
	"Value returned" message in response to "finish", when not
	produced by GDB/MI.  (Bug#23720)

2016-06-10  David Reitter  <david.reitter@gmail.com>

	Simplify pre-write-conversion for utf-8-hfs coding system

	* lisp/international/ucs-normalize.el
	(ucs-normalize-hfs-nfd-pre-write-conversion): Refactor.

	May address an issue where Emacs consumed large amounts of CPU
	because of neverending toolbar updating (which was caused
	by, but also called this function).

2016-06-09  Martin Rudalics  <rudalics@gmx.at>

	Revert "Bind `widget-button-click' to mouse-1/-2 instead of down-mouse-1/-2"

	* lisp/wid-edit.el (widget-keymap): Bind `widget-button-click'
	to mouse-1/-2 instead of down-mouse-1/-2.  Suggested by Stefan
	Monnier.  (Bug#19185, Bug#20398)

	This reverts commit 72166f2f3dba18f1217c666574032f5a0351ed65.

	That commit did more harm than good (Bug#23571).

2016-06-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port __builtin_assume_aligned to Sun C 5.13

	* src/conf_post.h (__builtin_assume_aligned):
	Fix typo: the extra arg did not conform to C99.

2016-06-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Prefer getsockopt to getpeername on non-MS-Windows

	* admin/CPP-DEFINES: Remove HAVE_GETPEERNAME.
	* configure.ac: Don’t check for getpeername.
	* src/process.c (wait_reading_process_output) [!WINDOWSNT]:
	Use getsockopt even if not GNU/Linux, as the platforms where
	getsockopt used to hang are no doubt long dead.

2016-06-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix XFASTINT of non-fixnum in process status

	* src/process.c (decode_status): 3rd arg is now Lisp_Object *,
	not int *, and is not decoded.  All uses changed.
	(status_message): Do not assume ‘failed’ code is an integer.
	* src/process.h: Document codes better.

2016-06-09  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	CC Mode now uses the new :after-hook feature of define-derived-mode

	It now runs internal variable setting functions after the mode hooks, no
	longer runs the mode hooks twice, and declares the configuration variables for
	noise macros and macros with semicolons as safe variables (when given suitable
	arguments).

	Fixes bug #16759 and bug #23476.

	* .dir-locals.el: Put the c-noise-macros-with-paren-names setting
	back into the C Mode value.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-mode.el: (c-basic-common-init): Remove the call to
	c-make-macro-with-semi-re.
	(c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, java-mode, idl-mode, pike-mode, awk-mode): Move
	c-make-noise-macro-regexps and c-make-macro-with-semi-re (where appropriate)
	and c-update-modeline into the :after-hook form.  Remove the explicit settings
	of the syntax table, the abbreviation table and the local key map, since they
	duplicate forms generated by define-derived-mode.  Remove the explicit
	invocation of each mode's mode hook, since they duplicate ones generated by
	define-derived-mode.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-vars.el: (c-string-list-p, c-string-or-string-list-p): New
	functions.
	(c-noise-macro-names, c-noise-macro-with-parens-names): give the
	save-local-variable property c-string-list-p.
	(c-macro-names-with-semicolon): give the save-local-variable property
	c-string-or-string-list-p.

	* doc/misc/cc-mode.texi: (Macros with ;, Noise Macros): Note that it's not
	necessary to call the regexp generating functions after setting the pertinent
	configuration values in a mode hook.

	Call hack-local-variables from major modes rather than from file visiting

	* lisp/files.el (normal-mode): Call `hack-local-variables' when the major mode

2016-03-20  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	Amend parse-partial-sexp correctly to handle two character comment delimiters

	Do this by adding a new field to the parser state: the syntax of the last
	character scanned, should that be the first char of a (potential) two char
	construct, nil otherwise.
	This should make the parser state complete.
	Also document element 9 of the parser state.  Also refactor the code a bit.

	* src/syntax.c (struct lisp_parse_state): Add a new field.
	(SYNTAX_FLAGS_COMSTARTEND_FIRST): New function.
	(internalize_parse_state): New function, extracted from scan_sexps_forward.
	(back_comment): Call internalize_parse_state.
	(forw_comment): Return the syntax of the last character scanned to the caller
	when that character might be the first of a two character construct.
	(Fforward_comment, scan_lists): New dummy variables, passed to forw_comment.
	(scan_sexps_forward): Remove a redundant state parameter.  Access all `state'
	information via the address parameter `state'.  Remove the code which converts
	from external to internal form of `state'.  Access buffer contents only from
	`from' onwards.  Reformulate code at the top of the main loop correctly to
	recognize comment openers when starting in the middle of one.  Call
	forw_comment with extra argument (for return of syntax value of possible first
	char of a two char construct).
	(Fparse_partial_sexp): Document elements 9, 10 of the parser state in the
	doc string.  Clarify the doc string in general.  Call
	internalize_parse_state.  Take account of the new elements when consing up the
	output parser state.

	* doc/lispref/syntax.texi: (Parser State): Document element 9 and the new
	element 10.  Minor wording corrections (remove reference to "trivial
	cases").
	(Low Level Parsing): Minor corrections.

	* etc/NEWS: Note new element 10, and documentation of element 9 of parser
	state.

	ensurements, don't insert too many blank lines.

	Stop calling res_init

	Emacs shouldn’t need to call res_init any more, now that nscd or
	equivalent is everywhere.  On modern systems, calling res_init

	* src/w32.c (sys_write): If 'send' returns with WSAENOTCONN, and
	this is a non-blocking socket whose connection is in progress, set
	errno to EWOULDBLOCK, as expected by GnuTLS and other callers.
	Avoid overwriting the errno value from 'send' by 'ioctlsocket'.
	Suggested by Alain Schneble <a.s@realize.ch>.  (Bug#22789)

	Strip out some leading whitespace when looking at logs

	* lisp/vc/vc-git.el (vc-git-expanded-log-entry): When looking
	at expanded git logs with `vc-print-root-log' (C-x v L, then
	<enter> by default), Emacs was stripping out all leading
	whitespace from git logs.  I now strip exactly 2 leading
	spaces, which retains the indentation in the logs (bug#18110).

	--enable-gcc-warnings now uses -Wjump-misses-init

	When configuring with --enable-gcc-warnings, also enable
	-Wjump-misses-init, as it’s confusing to use a goto to skip over
	an initialization.  Fix the few places in the code that run afoul
	of this warning.

	reset_w32_kbdhook_state.
	(lookup_vk_code): When the keyboard hook is active, map
	alphanumeric characters to themselves.
	(w32_parse_and_hook_hot_key): Renamed from w32_parse_hot_key.  Map

	(get_lisp_to_sockaddr_size, Fset_process_datagram_address)
	(connect_network_socket):

	same style here as elsewhere in Emacs.
	(string_integer_p): Remove; all uses removed.
	(Fmake_network_process): Check that port number is in range.

	Teach vc-hg how to read some Mercurial internal data structures,
	allowing us to avoid the need to run hg status -A, which is very slow
	for large repositories.  Fall back to running hg if anything looks
	funny.  vc-hg now puts the _working directory_ revision in the
	modeline instead of the file revision, which greatly improves
	performance and which allows us to again skip running hg in the case
	that we have an active bookmark.

	* lisp/vc/vc-hg.el (vc-hg-state): Try calling `vc-hg-statefast'
	(vc-hg-symbolic-revision-styles)
	(vc-hg-use-file-version-for-mode-line-version)
	(vc-hg-parse-hg-data-structures): New user preferences
	(vc-hg--active-bookmark-internal, vc-hg--run-log)

	(vc-hg--read-u8, vc-hg--read-u32-be)
	(vc-hg--raw-dirstate-search, vc-hg--cached-dirstate-search)
	(vc-hg--parts-to-string, vc-hg--pcre-to-elisp-re)

	(vc-hg--hgignore-add-glob, vc-hg--hgignore-add-path)
	(vc-hg--slurp-hgignore-1, vc-hg--slurp-hgignore)
	(vc-hg--ignore-patterns-valid-p)

	(vc-hg--file-ignored-p, vc-hg--read-repo-requirements)
	(vc-hg--requirements-understood-p, vc-hg--dirstate-scan-cache)
	(vc-hg-state-fast): New functions.
	(vc-hg--hgignore-patterns, vc-hg--hgignore-filenames)
	(vc-hg--cached-ignore-patterns, vc-hg--dirstate-scan-cache)
	(vc-hg--dirstate-scan-cache): New internal variables.
	* lisp/vc/vc-hooks.el (vc-refresh-state): Invoke vc find-file-hook

	Reported by Herbert J. Skuhra in:
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-02/msg00336.html
	* src/lisp.h (NONPOINTER_BITS) [__FreeBSD__]: Zero in this case too,
	since malloc always returns a multiple of 8 in FreeBSD.

2016-02-07  Alan Mackenzie  <acm@muc.de>

	message-valid-fqdn-regexp no longer exists

	* lisp/gnus/gnus-art.el (gnus-button-valid-fqdn-regexp): Don't use
	the no-longer-existing message-valid-fqdn-regexp variable.

2016-02-06  Lars Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

2016-02-06  David Edmondson  <dme@dme.org>

	* src/process.c (conv_lisp_to_sockaddr): AF_INET6 addresses are
	converted to a list of 16 bit quantities by
	conv_sockaddr_to_lisp(). conv_lisp_to_sockaddr() should follow the
	same scheme rather than expecting a (longer) list of 8 bit
	quantities.

2016-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Omit XLI (init) == 0 optimization in make-vector

	* src/alloc.c (Fmake_vector): Simplify by omitting the (XLI (init)
	== 0) case, as this optimization is probably not worth the hassle.
	Just for the record, the test for that case could have been
	(XLI (init) % ((EMACS_UINT) -1 / UCHAR_MAX) == 0) (!),
	assuming the typical platform with no padding bits and where
	conversion to int omits the most significant bits.

2016-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2016-02-04  Lars Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

	Only do async DNS if requested with :nowait 'dns

	* doc/lispref/processes.texi (Network Processes): Mention the
	dns value of :nowait.

	* src/alloc.c (Fmake_vector):
	* src/ccl.c (setup_ccl_program):
	Use memset to clear array.
	* src/alloc.c (Fvector, Fmake_byte_code):

2016-02-04  Nicolas Petton  <nicolas@petton.fr>

	Do not ignore redirections of 301, 302 and 307 status codes

	The current version of HTTP/1.1 (RFC 7231) no longer requires
	confirmation on 301, 302 or 307 status codes, therefore we do not have
	to ignore redirects for other requests than GET and HEAD.

	* lisp/url/url-http.el (url-http-parse-headers): Do not ignore 301, 302
	and 307 redirects for other requests than GET and HEAD.

2016-02-04  Mark Oteiza  <mvoteiza@udel.edu>

	* lisp/net/eww.el (eww-switch-to-buffer): Use pop-to-buffer-same-window instead.

2016-02-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Simplify USE_ALIGNED_ALLOC

	Remove packages obsoleted before Emacs 24.

	In accordance with the policy discussed in the emacs-devel list,
	packages that have been obsoleted for a full major release cycle are up
	for deletion.

	This removes almost all packages that are now eligible for deletion,
	with the exception of "cl-compat", which seems it is likely to still be
	used, and "optional", which offers some functionality that doesn't have
	a replacement yet.

2016-02-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Mention context when resume from emergency escape

	That way, if the user has been doing something else for a while,

	Support new arguments --help, all, autoconf, git.
	By default, just do autoconf-related configuration, not git.
	Prefer 'echo' to 'cat <<EOF ...', as this tends to avoid temp files.
	If GNU cp is available, use it to backup .git/config before
	changing it.  When configuring git, chatter about what is being
	done, and configure git to check hashes.  Avoid some duplicate
	file name specification when creating git hooks.

	* GNUmakefile (ALL_IF_GIT): New macro.
	(configure): Use it.
	* INSTALL.REPO: Suggest './autogen.sh all'.

	* src/eval.c (vformat_string): Refactor out the printing bits
	from verror.

2016-01-30  Wolfgang Jenkner  <wjenkner@inode.at>

	Link temacs with gnulib compiled with -Demacs

	(__realloc_hook, __memalign_hook): Conditionalize out.
	(cfree, memalign, valloc): Ditto.

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-localvars): rename variable

	and adjust the comment about it.
	(ses-plist-delq): new defun.

	(ses--unbind-cell-name): new defun.
	(ses-relocate-symbol): Do not relocate symbol when it is a named cell.
	(ses-relocate-formula): Undo change of
	2011-12-27T19:30:39Z!vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net that was
	preventing relocation for named cell --- now doing this is delegated
	to function `ses-relocate-symbol'.
	(ses-relocate-range): In docstring, undo change of
	2016-01-03T07:31:52Z!johnw@newartisans.com, `ses-range' must remain
	lower case as it is not a variable.
	(ses-relocate-all): Cell name relocation : 1) check that cell is a
	renamed cell by testing `ses-cell' property to :ses-named, rather than
	comparing name to corresponding standard name. Set rowcol of renamed
	cell into the hashmap --- `ses-cell' property must not be used for
	that as the same name can be used for different locations in different
	SES sheets ; 2) use `local-variable-if-set-p' rather than `boundp' and
	`local-variable-p' to check if cell name is already in use in this
	sheet or needs initialisation.
	(ses-relocate-all): Cell value relocation : 1) like for name
	relocation use the `ses-cell' property rather than comparing actual
	name to corresponding standard name. 2) Correct bug introduced in
	2011-12-27T19:30:39Z!vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net, as the test was
	made the other way round than the intention --- ie value relocation
	was disabled for standard cell, not for renamed cell as was the
	intention.
	(ses-relocate-all): Add loop for unbinding deleted renamed cells
	names.
	(ses-killbuffer-hook): new defun.
	(ses-mode): Add the ses--ses-buffer-list maintenance mechanism ---
	kill buffer hook, plus pushing current buffer if new in list.
	(ses-delete-row, ses-delete-column): Collect deleted renamed cells
	into `ses--in-killing-named-cell-list'.
	(ses-rename-cell): Remove update of variable
	`ses--renamed-cell-symb-list', this variable is renamed to
	`ses--in-killing-named-cell-list', and its setting is done in
	functions `ses-delete-row' and , `ses-delete-column' now.
	(ses-rename-cell): Change correction of
	2015-12-30T23:10:37Z!vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net concerning
	computation of the range over which `cursor-intangible' property was
	to be updated. This correction was ok for non spilling cells, but not
	for cells spilling over following blank cells. Simply use
	`next-single-property-change' rather than computing the end column
	from column widths.

2015-12-30  Vincent Belaïche  <vincentb1@users.sourceforge.net>

	Correct ses-rename-cell cursor-intangible text prop updating.

	There were two problems:

	- First ses-rename-cell has to work when called non interactively
	  (with non-nil CELL argument), so in this case the start pos of
	  put-text-property cannot be plainly (point), you need a
	  ses-goto-print call before

	- Second, the range itself was computed erronously, only the first
	  char was affected instead of the full cell width. This was not
	  noticeable prior to changes (Deprecate `intangible' and
	  `point-entered' properties) made by Stefan on 2015-04-13T19:51:15Z

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-rename-cell): Correct computation of position range
	to which the 'cursor-intangible text property has to be set to cell

	Quick temporary hack to fix curcell refreshing.

	The problem was caused by change: 2015-04-13 Deprecate `intangible'
	and `point-entered' properties. The problem is that this change has
	removed the (setq ses--curcell t) setting in the ses-command-hook
	function.

	* lisp/ses.el (ses-check-curcell): replace `(eq ses--curcell t)' by just `t' as
	a condition to call function `ses-set-curcell'. Comment this as a quick
	temporary hack to make it work, as I don't know yet whether a definite
	correction would be to make the ses-set-curcell at every ses-check-curcell,
	or to revert to the previous approach, ie marking ses--curcell as out-of-date
	at every potentially cursor motion command.

	* lisp/calculator.el (calculator-define-key): Silence warning

	...about unknown calculator-mode-map.

2015-11-29  Eli Barzilay  <eli@barzilay.org>

	* lisp/calculator.el: more improvements and bugfixes.

	- Mark `calculator-paste-decimals' as obsolete.  (It wasn't having an
	  effect anyway.)

	- Simplify `calculator-number-to-string' by throwing most of the work
	  onto `number-to-string', leaving just some tweaks for decimal inputs.
	  This leads to some minor changes, for example, pasting "1x1" in hex
	  mode would warn that "x" is ignored and result in "11" (and it wasn't
	  done in decimal mode), whereas now it just ignores everything from the
	  "x" and on and result in a "1" just like in decimal input mode.  Also,
	  overflows are left for `number-to-string' to deal with.

	- `calculator-paste' is very simple as a result.

	- Extend the simplified `calculator-paste': with a prefix argument it
	  pastes a string as if the characters were entered.  This can be used
	  to reduce expressions, but note that it's a simple literal operation,
	  so precedence can be messed, a number can be paster while entering a
	  number, spaces and newlines matter, etc.

	- Fix a minor bug where "e+" in hex mode wouldn't use "+" as an
	  operator.

	- Fix a bug in `calculator-put-value': avoid grouping in the display
	  that is used to construct `calculator-curnum'.  This would trigger
	  when pasting or getting a value from a register in some radix mode
	  with a large enough value.  Another fix: make the output radix equal
	  the input one, otherwise numbers could be converted twice.

2015-11-29  Eli Barzilay  <eli@barzilay.org>

	* lisp/calculator.el: Re-do key bindings.

	Use a helper function that arranges a parent keymap that binds alternate
	case keys so if some letter key is unbound and it's un/shifted version
	is, it will get used.  This makes the global-map trickery unnecessary.

	Also switch to passing strings that name keys through `kbd'.

2015-11-29  Eli Barzilay  <eli@barzilay.org>

	* lisp/calculator.el: improve radix modes

	Fix prompt for some input radix with decimal output (eg, "BD" instead of
	the incorrect "B="); also, some minor docstring tweaks for these.

2015-11-29  Eli Barzilay  <eli@barzilay.org>

	* lisp/calculator.el: better reading of register names

	Use `register-read-with-preview' with a dynamically bound
	`register-alist' and a proper preview function to read register names.

2015-11-29  Eli Barzilay  <eli@barzilay.org>

	* lisp/calculator.el: General improvements

	Use things like `when', `unless', and `push'.

	Improve `calculator-last-input' so it doesn't barf when hitting `F1' in
	non-electric mode.

2015-11-28  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Fix a problem with gfilenotify in filenotify-tests.el

	* test/lisp/filenotify-tests.el
	(file-notify--test-expected-events): Remove.
	(file-notify--test-cleanup): Do not set that variable.
	(file-notify--test-with-events): EVENTS can also be a list of lists.

2015-11-20  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Rework file notifications, kqueue has problems with directory monitors

	* lisp/filenotify.el (file-notify-add-watch): Call the native
	add-watch function on the file, not on the dir.

	* src/kqueue.c (kqueue_compare_dir_list): Make also bookkeeping
	about already deleted entries.

	* test/automated/auto-revert-tests.el
	(auto-revert-test01-auto-revert-several-files): Do not call "cp -f"
	since this deletes the target file first.

	* test/automated/file-notify-tests.el (file-notify--test-event-test):
	Make stronger checks.
	(file-notify-test01-add-watch, file-notify-test02-events)
	(file-notify-test04-file-validity, file-notify-test05-dir-validity):
	Rewrite in order to call file monitors but directory monitors.

	events are lost in inotify and gfilenotify cases.

2015-11-19  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Handle more complex rename operation in kqueue

	* src/kqueue.c (pending_events): New variable.

	* lisp/progmodes/cc-defs.el: Use with-silent-modifications

	(c-save-buffer-state): Use with-silent-modifications when available.
	(c--macroexpand-all): Check macroexpand-all directly rather than
	c--mapcan-status.

2015-11-18  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/loadup.el: Set max-lisp-eval-depth here

	(BYTE_COMPILE_FLAGS): Adjust accordingly.

2015-11-18  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	directory name matches.
	(file-notify-add-watch): Add `create' to the flags for `kqueue'.

	* src/kqueue.c (kqueue_generate_event): Use watch_object as
	argument instead of ident.  Remove callback argument.  Adapt
	callees.  Check actions whether they are monitored flags.

	* test/automated/file-notify-tests.el (file-notify--test-library):

	`deleted' events.

	Minor fix to comment indentation and typo in last commit

	* lisp/linum.el (linum-update-window): Fix comment indentation and
	a typo.

2015-11-17  João Távora  <joaotavora@gmail.com>

	linum-mode plays more nicely with other margin-setting extensions

	linum.el will only modify the left margin if it needs to, and will
	only reset the it back to 0 if it guesses that no-one has touched that
	margin in the meantime.

	As such, this is a more of a workaround than an actual fix, but fixes
	the problems described in bug#20674 regarding the interaction with
	modes such as darkroom-mode and olivetti-mode.

	A similar fix was commited to nlinum.el in ELPA.git's
	e7f5f549fbfb740b911fb7f33b42381ecece56d8

	* lisp/linum.el (linum-delete-overlays): Restore margins more
	criteriously.
	(linum-update-window): Set margins more criteriously.

2015-11-17  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Code cleanup of kqueue.c

	* src/kqueue.c (kqueue_directory_listing): Skip "." and "..".
	(kqueue_compare_dir_list): Do not loop when calling
	directory_files_internal.  Remove checks for "." and "..", this is
	done in kqueue_directory_listing now.
	(Fkqueue_add_watch): Check for proper emacs_open flags.

2015-11-16  Daiki Ueno  <ueno@gnu.org>

	* lisp/image-mode.el: Support encrypted file

	(image-toggle-display-image): Read content from the buffer instead
	of the file, if the buffer holds a decrypted data.  (Bug#21870)

2015-11-16  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Doc changes for kqueue

	* doc/lispref/os.texi (File Notifications): Add kqueue as backend.
	Fix some glitches in the example.

2015-11-16  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Finish implementation in kqueue.c

	* src/kqueue.c (kqueue_directory_listing, kqueue_callback):
	Simplify access to list.
	(kqueue_compare_dir_list): Simplify access to list.  Raise

	* lisp/progmodes/verilog-mode.el (verilog-save-buffer-state): Add backquote

2015-11-15  Artur Malabarba  <bruce.connor.am@gmail.com>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el: Fix a decoding issue

	(package--with-response-buffer): Use `url-insert-buffer-contents'.
	The previous code had some issues with decoding. Refactoring that
	function allows us to use the decoding from url-handlers while still
	treating both sync and async requests the same.

	* lisp/url/url-handlers.el (url-insert-file-contents): Move some code to
	`url-insert-buffer-contents'.
	(url-insert-buffer-contents): New function

2015-11-15  Artur Malabarba  <bruce.connor.am@gmail.com>

	* lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el: Refactor -with-work-buffer-async

	(package--with-work-buffer-async): Reimplement as
	`package--with-response-buffer'.
	(package--with-work-buffer): Mark obsolete.
	(package--with-response-buffer): New macro. This is a more self
	contained and less contrived version of
	`package--with-work-buffer-async'.  It uses keyword arguments,
	doesn't have async on the name, doesn't fallback on
	`package--with-work-buffer', and has _much_ simpler error
	handling.

	(package--check-signature, package--download-one-archive)
	(package-install-from-archive, describe-package-1): Use it.

	(package--download-and-read-archives): Let
	`package--download-one-archive' take care of calling
	`package--update-downloads-in-progress'.

2015-11-15  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp/progmodes/verilog-mode.el: Use with-silent-modifications

	(verilog-save-buffer-state): Use with-silent-modifications when available.
	(verilog-save-font-no-change-functions): Don't bind
	before/after-change-functions if it's not needed.

2015-11-15  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	* src/kqueue.c (kqueue_directory_listing): New function.
	(kqueue_generate_event): New argument FILE1.  Adapt callees.
	(kqueue_compare_dir_list): Rewrite in order to make it more robust.

2015-11-14  Xue Fuqiao  <xfq.free@gmail.com>

2015-11-14  David Engster  <deng@randomsample.de>

	gitmerge: Fix git log command

	* admin/gitmerge.el (gitmerge-missing): Use '--left-only' since we
	only want commits from the branch that is to be merged.
	(gitmerge-setup-log-buffer): Use the same symmetric range as in
	`gitmerge-missing'.

2015-11-14  David Engster  <deng@randomsample.de>

	gitmerge: Try to detect cherry-picks

	* admin/gitmerge.el (gitmerge-default-branch): Change to
	origin/emacs-25.
	(gitmerge-missing): Use symmetric difference ('...') between
	branch and master so that cherry-picks can be detected.

2015-11-14  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Implement directory events

	* lisp/filenotify.el (file-notify-handle-event)

	* src/kqueue.c: Include <sys/time.h>.
	(kqueue_generate_event, kqueue_compare_dir_list): New functions.
	(kqueue_callback): Use them.  Call kevent() with a zero timeout.
	(Fkqueue_add_watch): Adapt docstring.  Support directory events.
	Compute initial directory listing.  Close file descriptor in case
	of errors.
	(syms_of_kqueue): Declare Qcreate.

2015-11-13  Xue Fuqiao  <xfq.free@gmail.com>

	Mention CONTRIBUTE in README

	Mention CONTRIBUTE in README, since it was moved from etc/ to root.
	* etc/TODO: Remove the reference to `etc/CONTRIBUTE'.

	Update verilog-mode.el to 2015-11-09-b121d60-vpo.

	* lisp/progmodes/verilog-mode.el (verilog-auto, verilog-delete-auto)
	(verilog-modi-cache-results, verilog-save-buffer-state)
	(verilog-save-font-no-change-functions): When internally suppressing change
	functions, use `inhibit-modification-hooks' and call
	`after-change-funtions' to more nicely work with user hooks.  Reported by
	Stefan Monnier.

	(verilog-auto, verilog-delete-auto, verilog-delete-auto-buffer):
	Create `verilog-delete-auto-buffer' to avoid double-calling
	fontification hooks.

	(verilog-restore-buffer-modified-p, verilog-auto)
	(verilog-save-buffer-state): Prefer restore-buffer-modified-p over
	set-buffer-modified-p. Reported by Stefan Monnier.

	(verilog-diff-auto, verilog-diff-buffers-p)
	(verilog-diff-ignore-regexp): Add `verilog-diff-ignore-regexp'.

	(verilog-auto-inst-port, verilog-read-sub-decls-expr): Fix
	AUTOINST with unpacked dimensional parameters, bug981. Reported by
	by Amol Nagapurkar.

	(verilog-read-decls, verilog-read-sub-decls-line): Avoid unneeded
	properties inside internal structures. No functional change
	intended.

2015-11-11  Wolfgang Jenkner  <wjenkner@inode.at>

	Build fixes for kqueue support.

	* src/kqueue.c (Fkqueue_add_watch): O_BINARY is not a POSIX open(3)
	flag.

	* configure.ac (HAVE_KQUEUE): There is no pkg-config module for native
	kqueue on *BSD.

2015-11-11  Michael Albinus  <michael.albinus@gmx.de>

	Continue kqueue implementation

	* lisp/filenotify.el (file-notify-handle-event)
	(file-notify-callback): Enable trace messages.

	* src/kqueue.c: Include also <sys/types.h>.
	(kqueue_callback): Remove watch in case of NOTE_DELETE or NOTE_RENAME.
	(Fkqueue_rm_watch, Fkqueue_valid_p): New functions.
	(syms_of_kqueue): Add them.
