@appendixsec Building Emacs
@cindex building Emacs
@pindex temacs

  This section explains the steps involved in building the Emacs
executable.  You don't have to know this material to build and install
Emacs, since the makefiles do all these things automatically.  This
information is pertinent to Emacs maintenance.

   Compilation of the C source files in the @file{src} directory
produces an executable file called @file{temacs}, also called a
@dfn{bare impure Emacs}.  It contains the Emacs Lisp interpreter and I/O
routines, but not the editing commands.

@cindex @file{loadup.el}
  The command @w{@samp{temacs -l loadup}} uses @file{temacs} to create
the real runnable Emacs executable.  These arguments direct
@file{temacs} to evaluate the Lisp files specified in the file
@file{loadup.el}.  These files set up the normal Emacs editing
environment, resulting in an Emacs which is still impure but no longer
bare.

  It takes a substantial time to load the standard Lisp files.  Luckily,
you don't have to do this each time you run Emacs; @file{temacs} can
dump out an executable program called @file{emacs} which has these files
preloaded.  @file{emacs} starts more quickly because it does not need to
load the files.  This is the Emacs executable that is normally
installed.

  To create @file{emacs}, use the command @samp{temacs -batch -l loadup
dump}.  The purpose of @samp{-batch} here is to prevent @file{temacs}
from trying to initialize any of its data on the terminal; this ensures
that the tables of terminal information are empty in the dumped Emacs.
The argument @samp{dump} tells @file{loadup.el} to dump a new executable
named @file{emacs}.

  Some operating systems don't support dumping.  On those systems, you
must start Emacs with the @samp{temacs -l loadup} command each time you
use it.  This takes a long time, but since you need to start Emacs once
a day at most---or once a week if you never log out---the extra time is
not too severe a problem.

@cindex @file{site-load.el}
  You can specify additional files to preload by writing a library named
@file{site-load.el} which loads them.  You may need to increase the
value of @code{PURESIZE}, in @file{src/puresize.h}, to make room for the
additional files.  (Try adding increments of 20000 until it is big
enough.)  However, the advantage of preloading additional files
decreases as machines get faster.  On modern machines, it is usually not
advisable.

@cindex @file{site-init.el}
  You can specify other things to be done in Lisp just before dumping by
putting them in a library named @file{site-init.el}.  However, if these
things might alter the behavior that users expect from an ordinary
unmodified Emacs, it is better to do them in @file{default.el}, so that
users can override them if they wish.  @xref{Start-up Summary}.

  Before @file{emacs} is dumped, the documentation strings for primitive
and preloaded functions (and variables) need to be found in the file
where they are stored.  This is done by calling
@code{Snarf-documentation} (@pxref{Accessing Documentation}).  These
strings were moved out of @file{emacs} to make it smaller.
@xref{Documentation Basics}.

@defun dump-emacs to-file from-file
@cindex unexec
  This function dumps the current state of Emacs into an executable file
@var{to-file}.  It takes symbols from @var{from-file} (this is normally
the executable file @file{temacs}).

If you use this function in an Emacs that was already dumped, you must
set @code{command-line-processed} to @code{nil} first for good results.
@xref{Command Line Arguments}.
@end defun

@deffn Command emacs-version
  This function returns a string describing the version of Emacs that is
running.  It is useful to include this string in bug reports.

@example
@group
(emacs-version)
  @result{} "GNU Emacs 19.22.1 of Fri Feb 27 1994 \
on slug (berkeley-unix)"
@end group
@end example

Called interactively, the function prints the same information in the
echo area.
@end deffn

@defvar emacs-build-time
  The value of this variable is the time at which Emacs was built at the
local site.

@example
@group
emacs-build-time
     @result{} "Fri Feb 27 14:55:57 1994"
@end group
@end example
@end defvar

@defvar emacs-version
The value of this variable is the version of Emacs being run.  It is a
string such as @code{"19.22.1"}.
@end defvar

@node Pure Storage, Garbage Collection, Building Emacs, GNU Emacs Internals
@appendixsec Pure Storage
@cindex pure storage

  There are two types of storage in GNU Emacs Lisp for user-created Lisp
objects: @dfn{normal storage} and @dfn{pure storage}.  Normal storage is
where all the new data which is created during an Emacs session is kept;
see the following section for information on normal storage.  Pure
storage is used for certain data in the preloaded standard Lisp files:
data that should never change during actual use of Emacs.

  Pure storage is allocated only while @file{temacs} is loading the
standard preloaded Lisp libraries.  In the file @file{emacs}, it is
marked as read-only (on operating systems which permit this), so that
the memory space can be shared by all the Emacs jobs running on the
machine at once.  Pure storage is not expandable; a fixed amount is
allocated when Emacs is compiled, and if that is not sufficient for the
preloaded libraries, @file{temacs} crashes.  If that happens, you will
have to increase the compilation parameter @code{PURESIZE} in the file
@file{src/puresize.h}.  This normally won't happen unless you try to
preload additional libraries or add features to the standard ones.

@defun purecopy object
  This function makes a copy of @var{object} in pure storage and returns
it.  It copies strings by simply making a new string with the same
characters in pure storage.  It recursively copies the contents of
vectors and cons cells.  It does not make copies of symbols, or any
other objects, but just returns them unchanged.  It signals an error if
asked to copy markers.

This function is used only while Emacs is being built and dumped; it is
called only in the file @file{emacs/lisp/loaddefs.el}.
@end defun

@defvar pure-bytes-used
  The value of this variable is the number of bytes of pure storage
allocated so far.  Typically, in a dumped Emacs, this number is very
close to the total amount of pure storage available---if it were not,
we would preallocate less.
@end defvar

@defvar purify-flag
  This variable determines whether @code{defun} should make a copy of the
function definition in pure storage.  If it is non-@code{nil}, then the
function definition is copied into pure storage.

  This flag is @code{t} while loading all of the basic functions for
building Emacs initially (allowing those functions to be sharable and
non-collectible).  It is set to @code{nil} when Emacs is saved out
as @file{emacs}.  The flag is set and reset in the C sources.

 You should not change this flag in a running Emacs.
@end defvar

@node Garbage Collection, Writing Emacs Primitives, Pure Storage, GNU Emacs Internals
@appendixsec Garbage Collection
@cindex garbage collector

@cindex memory allocation
  When a program creates a list or the user defines a new function (such
as by loading a library), then that data is placed in normal storage.
If normal storage runs low, then Emacs asks the operating system to
allocate more memory in blocks of 1k bytes.  Each block is used for one
type of Lisp object, so symbols, cons cells, markers, etc.@: are
segregated in distinct blocks in memory.  (Vectors, buffers and certain
other editing types, which are fairly large, are allocated in individual
blocks, one per object, while strings are packed into blocks of 8k
bytes.)

  It is quite common to use some storage for a while, then release it
by, for example, killing a buffer or deleting the last pointer to an
object.  Emacs provides a @dfn{garbage collector} to reclaim this
abandoned storage.  (This name is traditional, but ``garbage recycler''
might be a more intuitive metaphor for this facility.)

  The garbage collector operates by scanning all the objects that have
been allocated and marking those that are still accessible to Lisp
programs.  To begin with, all the symbols, their values and associated
function definitions, and any data presently on the stack, are
accessible.  Any objects which can be reached indirectly through other
accessible objects are also accessible.

  When this is finished, all inaccessible objects are garbage.  No
matter what the Lisp program or the user does, it is impossible to refer
to them, since there is no longer a way to reach them.  Their
space might as well be reused, since no one will notice.  That is what
the garbage collector arranges to do.

@cindex free list
  Unused cons cells are chained together onto a @dfn{free list} for
future allocation; likewise for symbols and markers.  The accessible
strings are compacted so they are contiguous in memory; then the rest of
the space formerly occupied by strings is made available to the string
creation functions.  Vectors, buffers, windows and other large objects
are individually allocated and freed using @code{malloc}.

@cindex CL note---allocate more storage
@quotation
@b{Common Lisp note:} unlike other Lisps, GNU Emacs Lisp does not
call the garbage collector when the free list is empty.  Instead, it
simply requests the operating system to allocate more storage, and
processing continues until @code{gc-cons-threshold} bytes have been
used.

This means that you can make sure that the garbage collector will not
run during a certain portion of a Lisp program by calling the garbage
collector explicitly just before it (provided that portion of the
program does not use so much space as to force a second garbage
collection).
@end quotation

@deffn Command garbage-collect
  This command runs a garbage collection, and returns information on
the amount of space in use.  (Garbage collection can also occur
spontaneously if you use more than @code{gc-cons-threshold} bytes of
Lisp data since the previous garbage collection.)

  @code{garbage-collect} returns a list containing the following
information:

@smallexample
@group
((@var{used-conses} . @var{free-conses})
 (@var{used-syms} . @var{free-syms})
 (@var{used-markers} . @var{free-markers})
 @var{used-string-chars} 
 @var{used-vector-slots}
 (@var{used-floats} . @var{free-floats}))

(garbage-collect)
     @result{} ((3435 . 2332) (1688 . 0)
           (57 . 417) 24510 3839 (4 . 1))
@end group
@end smallexample

Here is a table explaining each element:

@table @var
@item used-conses
The number of cons cells in use.

@item free-conses
The number of cons cells for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.

@item used-syms
The number of symbols in use.

@item free-syms
The number of symbols for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.

@item used-markers
The number of markers in use.

@item free-markers
The number of markers for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.

@item used-string-chars
The total size of all strings, in characters.

@item used-vector-slots
The total number of elements of existing vectors.

@item used-floats
@c Emacs 19 feature
The number of floats in use.

@item free-floats
@c Emacs 19 feature
The number of floats for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.
@end table
@end deffn

@defopt gc-cons-threshold
  The value of this variable is the number of bytes of storage that must
be allocated for Lisp objects after one garbage collection in order to
request another garbage collection.  A cons cell counts as eight bytes,
a string as one byte per character plus a few bytes of overhead, and so
on.  (Space allocated to the contents of buffers does not count.)  Note
that the new garbage collection does not happen immediately when the
threshold is exhausted, but only the next time the Lisp evaluator is
called.

  The initial threshold value is 100,000.  If you specify a larger
value, garbage collection will happen less often.  This reduces the
amount of time spent garbage collecting, but increases total memory use.
You may want to do this when running a program which creates lots of
Lisp data.

  You can make collections more frequent by specifying a smaller value,
down to 10,000.  A value less than 10,000 will remain in effect only
until the subsequent garbage collection, at which time
@code{garbage-collect} will set the threshold back to 10,000.
@end defopt

@c Emacs 19 feature
@defun memory-limit
This function returns the address of the last byte Emacs has allocated,
divided by 1024.  We divide the value by 1024 to make sure it fits in a
Lisp integer.

You can use this to get a general idea of how your actions affect the
memory usage.

@appendixsec Writing Emacs Primitives
@cindex primitive function internals

  Lisp primitives are Lisp functions implemented in C.  The details of
interfacing the C function so that Lisp can call it are handled by a few
C macros.  The only way to really understand how to write new C code is
to read the source, but we can explain some things here.

  An example of a special form is the definition of @code{or}, from
@file{eval.c}.  (An ordinary function would have the same general
appearance.)

    @}

@end group

@group
  UNGCPRO;

@end group
@end smallexample

  Let's start with a precise explanation of the arguments to the
@code{DEFUN} macro.  Here are the general names for them:

@example
DEFUN (@var{lname}, @var{fname}, @var{sname}, @var{min}, @var{max}, @var{interactive}, @var{doc})
@end example

@table @var
@item lname
This is the name of the Lisp symbol to define with this
function; in the example above, it is @code{or}.

@item fname
This is the C function name for this function.  This is
the name that is used in C code for calling the function.  The name is,
by convention, @samp{F} prepended to the Lisp name, with all dashes
(@samp{-}) in the Lisp name changed to underscores.  Thus, to call this
function from C code, call @code{For}.  Remember that the arguments must
be of type @code{Lisp_Object}; various macros and functions for creating
values of type @code{Lisp_Object} are declared in the file
@file{lisp.h}.

@item sname
This is a C variable name to use for a structure that holds the data for
the subr object that represents the function in Lisp.  This structure
conveys the Lisp symbol name to the initialization routine that will
create the symbol and store the subr object as its definition.  By
convention, this name is always @var{fname} with @samp{F} replaced with
@samp{S}.

@item min
This is the minimum number of arguments that the function requires.  For
@code{or}, no arguments are required.

@item max
This is the maximum number of arguments that the function accepts.
Alternatively, it can be @code{UNEVALLED}, indicating a special form
that receives unevaluated arguments.  A function with the equivalent of
an @code{&rest} argument would have @code{MANY} in this position.  Both
@code{UNEVALLED} and @code{MANY} are macros.  This argument must be one
of these macros or a number at least as large as @var{min}.  It may not
be greater than six.

@item interactive
This is an interactive specification, a string such as might be used as
the argument of @code{interactive} in a Lisp function.  In the case of
@code{or}, it is 0 (a null pointer), indicating that @code{or} cannot be
called interactively.  A value of @code{""} indicates an interactive
function taking no arguments.

@item doc
This is the documentation string.  It is written just like a
documentation string for a function defined in Lisp, except you must
write @samp{\n\} at the end of each line.  In particular, the first line
should be a single sentence.
@end table

  After the call to the @code{DEFUN} macro, you must write the list
of argument names that every C function must have, followed by
ordinary C declarations for them.  Normally, all the arguments must
be declared as @code{Lisp_Object}.  If the function has no upper limit
on the number of arguments in Lisp, then in C it receives two arguments:
the number of Lisp arguments, and the address of a block containing their
values.  These have types @code{int} and @w{@code{Lisp_Object *}}.

  Within the function @code{For} itself, note the use of the macros
@code{GCPRO1} and @code{UNGCPRO}.  @code{GCPRO1} is used to ``protect''
a variable from garbage collection---to inform the garbage collector that
it must look in that variable and regard its contents as an accessible
object.  This is necessary whenever you call @code{Feval} or anything
that can directly or indirectly call @code{Feval}.  At such a time, any
Lisp object that you intend to refer to again must be protected somehow.
@code{UNGCPRO} cancels the protection of the variables that are
protected in the current function.  It is necessary to do this explicitly.

  For most data types, it suffices to know that one pointer to the
object is protected; as long as the object is not recycled, all pointers
to it remain valid.  This is not so for strings, because the garbage
collector can move them.  When a string is moved, any pointers to it
that the garbage collector does not know about will not be properly
relocated.  Therefore, all pointers to strings must be protected across
any point where garbage collection may be possible.

  The macro @code{GCPRO1} protects just one local variable.  If you
want to protect two, use @code{GCPRO2} instead; repeating @code{GCPRO1}
will not work.  There are also @code{GCPRO3} and @code{GCPRO4}.

  In addition to using these macros, you must declare the local
variables such as @code{gcpro1} which they implicitly use.  If you
protect two variables, with @code{GCPRO2}, you must declare
@code{gcpro1} and @code{gcpro2}, as it uses them both.  Alas, we can't
explain all the tricky details here.

  Defining the C function is not enough; you must also create the
Lisp symbol for the primitive and store a suitable subr object
in its function cell.  This is done by adding code to an initialization
routine.  The code looks like this:

@example
defsubr (&@var{subr-structure-name});
@end example

@noindent
@var{subr-structure-name} is the name you used as the third argument to
@code{DEFUN}.

  If you are adding a primitive to a file that already has Lisp
primitives defined in it, find the function (near the end of the file)
named @code{syms_of_@var{something}}, and add that function call to it.
If the file doesn't have this function, or if you create a new file, add
to it a @code{syms_of_@var{filename}} (e.g., @code{syms_of_myfile}).
Then find the spot in @file{emacs.c} where all of these functions are
called, and add a call to @code{syms_of_@var{filename}} there.

  This function @code{syms_of_@var{filename}} is also the place to
define any C variables which are to be visible as Lisp variables.
@code{DEFVAR_LISP} is used to make a C variable of type
@code{Lisp_Object} visible in Lisp.  @code{DEFVAR_INT} is used to make a
C variable of type @code{int} visible in Lisp with a value that is an
integer.

  Here is another function, with more complicated arguments.  This comes
from the code for the X Window System, and it demonstrates the use of
macros and functions to manipulate Lisp objects.

@smallexample
@group
DEFUN ("coordinates-in-window-p", Fcoordinates_in_window_p,

    @{
      return Qnil;
    @}
  XFASTINT (xcoord) -= XFASTINT (XWINDOW (window)->left);

@group
  if (XINT (ycoord) == (screen_height - 1))
    return Qnil;
@end group
@group
  if ((XINT (ycoord) < XINT (XWINDOW (window)->top))
      || (XINT (ycoord) >= (XINT (XWINDOW (window)->top)
                            + XINT (XWINDOW (window)->height)) - 1))
    @{
      return Qnil;
    @}
@end group
@group
  XFASTINT (ycoord) -= XFASTINT (XWINDOW (window)->top);
  return (Fcons (xcoord, Fcons (ycoord, Qnil)));
@}
@end group
@end smallexample

  Note that you cannot directly call functions defined in Lisp as, for
example, the primitive function @code{Fcons} is called above.  You must
create the appropriate Lisp form, protect everything from garbage
collection, and @code{Feval} the form, as was done in @code{For} above.

  @file{eval.c} is a very good file to look through for examples;
@file{lisp.h} contains the definitions for some important macros and
functions.

@node Object Internals,  , Writing Emacs Primitives, GNU Emacs Internals
@appendixsec Object Internals
@cindex object internals

  GNU Emacs Lisp manipulates many different types of data.  The actual
data are stored in a heap and the only access that programs have to it is
through pointers.  Pointers are thirty-two bits wide in most
implementations.  Depending on the operating system and type of machine
for which you compile Emacs, twenty-four to twenty-six bits are used to
address the object, and the remaining six to eight bits are used for a
tag that identifies the object's type.

  Because all access to data is through tagged pointers, it is always
possible to determine the type of any object.  This allows variables to
be untyped, and the values assigned to them to be changed without regard
to type.  Function arguments also can be of any type; if you want a
function to accept only a certain type of argument, you must check the
type explicitly using a suitable predicate (@pxref{Type Predicates}).

  Buffers contain fields not directly accessible by the Lisp programmer.
We describe them here, naming them by the names used in the C code.
Many are accessible indirectly in Lisp programs via Lisp primitives.

@table @code
@item name
The buffer name is a string which names the buffer.  It is guaranteed to
be unique.  @xref{Buffer Names}.

@item save_modified
This field contains the time when the buffer was last saved, as an integer.
@xref{Buffer Modification}.

@item modtime
This field contains the modification time of the visited file.  It is
set when the file is written or read.  Every time the buffer is written
to the file, this field is compared to the modification time of the
file.  @xref{Buffer Modification}.

@item auto_save_modified
This field contains the time when the buffer was last auto-saved.

@item last_window_start
This field contains the @code{window-start} position in the buffer as of
the last time the buffer was displayed in a window.

@item undodata
This field points to the buffer's undo stack.  @xref{Undo}.

@item syntax_table_v
This field contains the syntax table for the buffer.  @xref{Syntax Tables}.

@item downcase_table
This field contains the conversion table for converting text to lower case.
@xref{Case Table}.

@item upcase_table
This field contains the conversion table for converting text to upper case.
@xref{Case Table}.

@item case_canon_table
This field contains the conversion table for canonicalizing text for
case-folding search.  @xref{Case Table}.

@item case_eqv_table
This field contains the equivalence table for case-folding search.
@xref{Case Table}.

@item display_table
This field contains the buffer's display table, or @code{nil} if it doesn't
have one.  @xref{Display Tables}.

@item markers
This field contains the chain of all markers that point into the
buffer.  At each deletion or motion of the buffer gap, all of these
markers must be checked and perhaps updated.  @xref{Markers}.

@item backed_up
This field is a flag which tells whether a backup file has been made
for the visited file of this buffer.

@item mark
This field contains the mark for the buffer.  The mark is a marker,
hence it is also included on the list @code{markers}.  @xref{The Mark}.

@item local_var_alist
This field contains the association list containing all of the variables
local in this buffer, and their values.  The function
@code{buffer-local-variables} returns a copy of this list.

selected; when it is not selected, it retains its previous value.

@item left
  This is the left-hand edge of the window, measured in columns.  (The
leftmost column on the screen is @w{column 0}.)

@item top
  This is the top edge of the window, measured in lines.  (The top line on
the screen is @w{line 0}.)

@item next
  This is the window that is the next in the chain of siblings.

@item prev
  This is the window that is the previous in the chain of siblings.

@item force_start
  This is a flag which, if non-@code{nil}, says that the window has been
scrolled explicitly by the Lisp program.  At the next redisplay, if
point is off the screen, instead of scrolling the window to show the
text around point, point will be moved to a location that is on the
screen.

@item hscroll
  This is the number of columns that the display in the window is scrolled
horizontally to the left.  Normally, this is 0.

@item use_time
  This is the last time that the window was selected.  The function
@code{get-lru-window} uses this field.

@item display_table
  The window's display table, or @code{nil} if none is specified for it.

@cindex internals, of process
@cindex process internals

  The fields of a process are:

@table @code
@item name
A string, the name of the process.

@item command
A list containing the command arguments that were used to start this
process.

@item filter
A function used to accept output from the process instead of a buffer,
or @code{nil}.

@item sentinel
A function called whenever the process receives a signal, or @code{nil}.

@item buffer
The associated buffer of the process.

@item pid
An integer, the Unix process @sc{id}.

@item childp
A flag, non-@code{nil} if this is really a child process.
It is @code{nil} for a network connection.

@item flags
A symbol indicating the state of the process.  Possible values include
@code{run}, @code{stop}, @code{closed}, etc.

@item reason
An integer, the Unix signal number that the process received that
caused the process to terminate or stop.  If the process has exited,
then this is the exit code it specified.

@item mark
A marker indicating the position of end of last output from this process
inserted into the buffer.  This is usually the end of the buffer.

@item kill_without_query
A flag, non-@code{nil} meaning this process should not cause
confirmation to be needed if Emacs is killed.
