   Redisplay.

   Emacs separates the task of updating the display from code
   modifying global state, e.g. buffer text.  This way functions
   operating on buffers don't also have to be concerned with updating
   the display.

   Updating the display is triggered by the Lisp interpreter when it
   decides it's time to do it.  This is done either automatically for
   you as part of the interpreter's command loop or as the result of
   calling Lisp functions like `sit-for'.  The C function `redisplay'
   in xdisp.c is the only entry into the inner redisplay code.

   The following diagram shows how redisplay code is invoked.  As you
   can see, Lisp calls redisplay and vice versa.  Under window systems
   like X, some portions of the redisplay code are also called
   asynchronously during mouse movement or expose events.  It is very
   important that these code parts do NOT use the C library (malloc,
   free) because many C libraries under Unix are not reentrant.  They
   may also NOT call functions of the Lisp interpreter which could
   change the interpreter's state.  If you don't follow these rules,
   you will encounter bugs which are very hard to explain.

   What does redisplay do?  Obviously, it has to figure out somehow what
   has been changed since the last time the display has been updated,
   and to make these changes visible.  Preferably it would do that in
   a moderately intelligent way, i.e. fast.

   Changes in buffer text can be deduced from window and buffer
   structures, and from some global variables like `beg_unchanged' and
   `end_unchanged'.  The contents of the display are additionally
   recorded in a `glyph matrix', a two-dimensional matrix of glyph
   structures.  Each row in such a matrix corresponds to a line on the
   display, and each glyph in a row corresponds to a column displaying
   a character, an image, or what else.  This matrix is called the
   `current glyph matrix' or `current matrix' in redisplay
   terminology.

   For buffer parts that have been changed since the last update, a
   second glyph matrix is constructed, the so called `desired glyph
   matrix' or short `desired matrix'.  Current and desired matrix are
   then compared to find a cheap way to update the display, e.g. by
   reusing part of the display by scrolling lines.

   You will find a lot of redisplay optimizations when you start
   looking at the innards of redisplay.  The overall goal of all these
   optimizations is to make redisplay fast because it is done
   frequently.  Some of these optimizations are implemented by the
   following functions:

    . try_cursor_movement

      This function tries to update the display if the text in the
      window did not change and did not scroll, only point moved, and
      it did not move off the displayed portion of the text.

    . try_window_reusing_current_matrix

      This function reuses the current matrix of a window when text
      has not changed, but the window start changed (e.g., due to
      scrolling).

    . try_window_id

      This function attempts to redisplay a window by reusing parts of
      its existing display.  It finds and reuses the part that was not
      changed, and redraws the rest.  (The "id" part in the function's
      name stands for "insert/delete", not for "identification" or
      somesuch.)

    . try_window

      This function performs the full redisplay of a single window
      assuming that its fonts were not changed and that the cursor
      will not end up in the scroll margins.  (Loading fonts requires
      re-adjustment of dimensions of glyph matrices, which makes this
      method impossible to use.)

   These optimizations are tried in sequence (some can be skipped if
   it is known that they are not applicable).  If none of the
   optimizations were successful, redisplay calls redisplay_windows,
   which performs a full redisplay of all windows.

   Note that there's one more important optimization up Emacs's
   sleeve, but it is related to actually redrawing the potentially
   changed portions of the window/frame, not to reproducing the
   desired matrices of those potentially changed portions.  Namely,
   the function update_frame and its subroutines, which you will find
   in dispnew.c, compare the desired matrices with the current
   matrices, and only redraw the portions that changed.  So it could
   happen that the functions in this file for some reason decide that
   the entire desired matrix needs to be regenerated from scratch, and
   still only parts of the Emacs display, or even nothing at all, will
   be actually delivered to the glass, because update_frame has found
   that the new and the old screen contents are similar or identical.

   Desired matrices.

   Desired matrices are always built per Emacs window.  The function
   `display_line' is the central function to look at if you are
   interested.  It constructs one row in a desired matrix given an
   iterator structure containing both a buffer position and a
   description of the environment in which the text is to be
   displayed.  But this is too early, read on.

   Characters and pixmaps displayed for a range of buffer text depend
   on various settings of buffers and windows, on overlays and text
   properties, on display tables, on selective display.  The good news
   is that all this hairy stuff is hidden behind a small set of
   interface functions taking an iterator structure (struct it)
   argument.

   Iteration over things to be displayed is then simple.  It is
   started by initializing an iterator with a call to init_iterator,
   passing it the buffer position where to start iteration.  For
   iteration over strings, pass -1 as the position to init_iterator,
   and call reseat_to_string when the string is ready, to initialize
   the iterator for that string.  Thereafter, calls to
   get_next_display_element fill the iterator structure with relevant
   information about the next thing to display.  Calls to
   set_iterator_to_next move the iterator to the next thing.

   Besides this, an iterator also contains information about the
   display environment in which glyphs for display elements are to be
   produced.  It has fields for the width and height of the display,
   the information whether long lines are truncated or continued, a
   current X and Y position, and lots of other stuff you can better
   see in dispextern.h.

   Glyphs in a desired matrix are normally constructed in a loop
   calling get_next_display_element and then PRODUCE_GLYPHS.  The call
   to PRODUCE_GLYPHS will fill the iterator structure with pixel
   information about the element being displayed and at the same time
   produce glyphs for it.  If the display element fits on the line
   being displayed, set_iterator_to_next is called next, otherwise the
   glyphs produced are discarded.  The function display_line is the
   workhorse of filling glyph rows in the desired matrix with glyphs.
   In addition to producing glyphs, it also handles line truncation
   and continuation, word wrap, and cursor positioning (for the
   latter, see also set_cursor_from_row).

   Frame matrices.

   That just couldn't be all, could it?  What about terminal types not
   supporting operations on sub-windows of the screen?  To update the
   display on such a terminal, window-based glyph matrices are not
   well suited.  To be able to reuse part of the display (scrolling
   lines up and down), we must instead have a view of the whole
   screen.  This is what `frame matrices' are for.  They are a trick.

   Frames on terminals like above have a glyph pool.  Windows on such
   a frame sub-allocate their glyph memory from their frame's glyph
   pool.  The frame itself is given its own glyph matrices.  By
   coincidence---or maybe something else---rows in window glyph
   matrices are slices of corresponding rows in frame matrices.  Thus
   writing to window matrices implicitly updates a frame matrix which
   provides us with the view of the whole screen that we originally
   wanted to have without having to move many bytes around.  To be
   honest, there is a little bit more done, but not much more.  If you
   plan to extend that code, take a look at dispnew.c.  The function
   build_frame_matrix is a good starting point.

   Bidirectional display.

   Bidirectional display adds quite some hair to this already complex
   design.  The good news are that a large portion of that hairy stuff
   is hidden in bidi.c behind only 3 interfaces.  bidi.c implements a
   reordering engine which is called by set_iterator_to_next and
   returns the next character to display in the visual order.  See
   commentary on bidi.c for more details.  As far as redisplay is
   concerned, the effect of calling bidi_move_to_visually_next, the
   main interface of the reordering engine, is that the iterator gets
   magically placed on the buffer or string position that is to be
   displayed next.  In other words, a linear iteration through the
   buffer/string is replaced with a non-linear one.  All the rest of
   the redisplay is oblivious to the bidi reordering.

   Well, almost oblivious---there are still complications, most of
   them due to the fact that buffer and string positions no longer
   change monotonously with glyph indices in a glyph row.  Moreover,
   for continued lines, the buffer positions may not even be
   monotonously changing with vertical positions.  Also, accounting
   for face changes, overlays, etc. becomes more complex because
   non-linear iteration could potentially skip many positions with
   changes, and then cross them again on the way back...

   One other prominent effect of bidirectional display is that some
   paragraphs of text need to be displayed starting at the right
   margin of the window---the so-called right-to-left, or R2L
   paragraphs.  R2L paragraphs are displayed with R2L glyph rows,
   which have their reversed_p flag set.  The bidi reordering engine
   produces characters in such rows starting from the character which
   should be the rightmost on display.  PRODUCE_GLYPHS then reverses
   the order, when it fills up the glyph row whose reversed_p flag is
   set, by prepending each new glyph to what is already there, instead
   of appending it.  When the glyph row is complete, the function
   extend_face_to_end_of_line fills the empty space to the left of the
   leftmost character with special glyphs, which will display as,
   well, empty.  On text terminals, these special glyphs are simply
   blank characters.  On graphics terminals, there's a single stretch
   glyph of a suitably computed width.  Both the blanks and the
   stretch glyph are given the face of the background of the line.
   This way, the terminal-specific back-end can still draw the glyphs
   left to right, even for R2L lines.

   Bidirectional display and character compositions

   Some scripts cannot be displayed by drawing each character
   individually, because adjacent characters change each other's shape
   on display.  For example, Arabic and Indic scripts belong to this
   category.

   Emacs display supports this by providing "character compositions",
   most of which is implemented in composite.c.  During the buffer
   scan that delivers characters to PRODUCE_GLYPHS, if the next
   character to be delivered is a composed character, the iteration
   calls composition_reseat_it and next_element_from_composition.  If
   they succeed to compose the character with one or more of the
   following characters, the whole sequence of characters that where
   composed is recorded in the `struct composition_it' object that is
   part of the buffer iterator.  The composed sequence could produce
   one or more font glyphs (called "grapheme clusters") on the screen.
   Each of these grapheme clusters is then delivered to PRODUCE_GLYPHS
   in the direction corresponding to the current bidi scan direction
   (recorded in the scan_dir member of the `struct bidi_it' object
   that is part of the buffer iterator).  In particular, if the bidi
   iterator currently scans the buffer backwards, the grapheme
   clusters are delivered back to front.  This reorders the grapheme
   clusters as appropriate for the current bidi context.  Note that
   this means that the grapheme clusters are always stored in the
   LGSTRING object (see composite.c) in the logical order.

   Moving an iterator in bidirectional text
   without producing glyphs

   Note one important detail mentioned above: that the bidi reordering
   engine, driven by the iterator, produces characters in R2L rows
   starting at the character that will be the rightmost on display.
   As far as the iterator is concerned, the geometry of such rows is
   still left to right, i.e. the iterator "thinks" the first character
   is at the leftmost pixel position.  The iterator does not know that
   PRODUCE_GLYPHS reverses the order of the glyphs that the iterator
   delivers.  This is important when functions from the move_it_*
   family are used to get to certain screen position or to match
   screen coordinates with buffer coordinates: these functions use the
   iterator geometry, which is left to right even in R2L paragraphs.
   This works well with most callers of move_it_*, because they need
   to get to a specific column, and columns are still numbered in the
   reading order, i.e. the rightmost character in a R2L paragraph is
   still column zero.  But some callers do not get well with this; a
   notable example is mouse clicks that need to find the character
   that corresponds to certain pixel coordinates.  See
   buffer_posn_from_coords in dispnew.c for how this is handled.  */

   To do that efficiently, we use many optimizations that try to make sure we
   don't waste too much time updating things that haven't changed.
   The coarsest such optimization is that, in the most common cases, we only
   look at the selected-window.

   To know whether other windows should be considered for redisplay, we use the
   variable windows_or_buffers_changed: as long as it is 0, it means that we
   have not noticed anything that should require updating anything else than
   the selected-window.  If it is set to REDISPLAY_SOME, it means that since
   last redisplay, some changes have been made which could impact other
   windows.  To know which ones need redisplay, every buffer, window, and frame
   has a `redisplay' bit, which (if true) means that this object needs to be
   redisplayed.  If windows_or_buffers_changed is 0, we know there's no point
   looking for those `redisplay' bits (actually, there might be some such bits
   set, but then only on objects which aren't displayed anyway).

   OTOH if it's non-zero we wil have to loop through all windows and then check
   the `redisplay' bit of the corresponding window, frame, and buffer, in order
   to decide whether that window needs attention or not.  Note that we can't
   just look at the frame's redisplay bit to decide that the whole frame can be
   skipped, since even if the frame's redisplay bit is unset, some of its
   windows's redisplay bits may be set.

   Mostly for historical reasons, windows_or_buffers_changed can also take
   other non-zero values.  In that case, the precise value doesn't matter (it
   encodes the cause of the setting but is only used for debugging purposes),
   and what it means is that we shouldn't pay attention to any `redisplay' bits
   and we should simply try and redisplay every window out there.  */

int windows_or_buffers_changed;

/* Nonzero if we should redraw the mode lines on the next redisplay.
   Similarly to `windows_or_buffers_changed', If it has value REDISPLAY_SOME,
   then only redisplay the mode lines in those buffers/windows/frames where the
   `redisplay' bit has been set.
   For any other value, redisplay all mode lines (the number used is then only
   used to track down the cause for this full-redisplay).

   Since the frame title uses the same %-constructs as the mode line
   (except %c, %C, and %l), if this variable is non-zero, we also consider
   redisplaying the title of each frame, see x_consider_frame_title.

   The `redisplay' bits are the same as those used for
   windows_or_buffers_changed, and setting windows_or_buffers_changed also
   causes recomputation of the mode lines of all those windows.  IOW this
   variable only has an effect if windows_or_buffers_changed is zero, in which
   case we should only need to redisplay the mode-line of those objects with
   a `redisplay' bit set but not the window's text content (tho we may still

     the various HANDLED_* statuses:

     HANDLED_NORMALLY means the handler did its job, and the loop
     should proceed to calling the next handler in order.

     HANDLED_RECOMPUTE_PROPS means the handler caused a significant
     change in the properties and overlays at current position, so the
     loop should be restarted, to re-invoke the handlers that were
     already called.  This happens when fontification-functions were
     called by handle_fontified_prop, and actually fontified
     something.  Another case where HANDLED_RECOMPUTE_PROPS is
     returned is when we discover overlay strings that need to be
     displayed right away.  The loop below will continue for as long
     as the status is HANDLED_RECOMPUTE_PROPS.

     HANDLED_RETURN means return immediately to the caller, to
     continue iteration without calling any further handlers.  This is
     used when we need to act on some property right away, for example
     when we need to display the ellipsis or a replacing display
     property, such as display string or image.

     HANDLED_OVERLAY_STRING_CONSUMED means an overlay string was just
     consumed, and the handler switched to the next overlay string.
     This signals the loop below to refrain from looking for more
     overlays before all the overlay strings of the current overlay
     are processed.

     Some of the handlers called by the loop push the iterator state
     onto the stack (see 'push_it'), and arrange for the iteration to
     continue with another object, such as an image, a display string,
     or an overlay string.  In most such cases, it->stop_charpos is
     set to the first character of the string, so that when the
     iteration resumes, this function will immediately be called
     again, to examine the properties at the beginning of the string.

     When a display or overlay string is exhausted, the iterator state
     is popped (see 'pop_it'), and iteration continues with the
     previous object.  Again, in many such cases this function is
     called again to find the next position where properties might

WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  The
return value is a cons of the maximum pixel-width of any text line and
the maximum pixel-height of all text lines.

The optional argument FROM, if non-nil, specifies the first text
position and defaults to the minimum accessible position of the buffer.
If FROM is t, use the minimum accessible position that starts a
non-empty line.  TO, if non-nil, specifies the last text position and
defaults to the maximum accessible position of the buffer.  If TO is t,
use the maximum accessible position that ends a non-empty line.

The optional argument X-LIMIT, if non-nil, specifies the maximum text
width that can be returned.  X-LIMIT nil or omitted, means to use the
pixel-width of WINDOW's body; use this if you want to know how high
WINDOW should be become in order to fit all of its buffer's text with
the width of WINDOW unaltered.  Use the maximum width WINDOW may assume
if you intend to change WINDOW's width.  In any case, text whose
x-coordinate is beyond X-LIMIT is ignored.  Since calculating the width
of long lines can take some time, it's always a good idea to make this
argument as small as possible; in particular, if the buffer contains
long lines that shall be truncated anyway.

The optional argument Y-LIMIT, if non-nil, specifies the maximum text
height (excluding the height of the mode- or header-line, if any) that
can be returned.  Text lines whose y-coordinate is beyond Y-LIMIT are
ignored.  Since calculating the text height of a large buffer can take
some time, it makes sense to specify this argument if the size of the
buffer is large or unknown.

Optional argument MODE-AND-HEADER-LINE nil or omitted means do not
include the height of the mode- or header-line of WINDOW in the return
value.  If it is either the symbol `mode-line' or `header-line', include
only the height of that line, if present, in the return value.  If t,
include the height of both, if present, in the return value.  */)

/* Redisplay leaf window WINDOW.  JUST_THIS_ONE_P means only
   selected_window is redisplayed.

   We can return without actually redisplaying the window if fonts has been
   changed on window's frame.  In that case, redisplay_internal will retry.

   As one of the important parts of redisplaying a window, we need to
   decide whether the previous window-start position (stored in the
   window's w->start marker position) is still valid, and if it isn't,
   recompute it.  Some details about that:

    . The previous window-start could be in a continuation line, in
      which case we need to recompute it when the window width
      changes.  See compute_window_start_on_continuation_line and its
      call below.

    . The text that changed since last redisplay could include the
      previous window-start position.  In that case, we try to salvage
      what we can from the current glyph matrix by calling
      try_scrolling, which see.

    . Some Emacs command could force us to use a specific window-start
      position by setting the window's force_start flag, or gently
      propose doing that by setting the window's optional_new_start
      flag.  In these cases, we try using the specified start point if
      that succeeds (i.e. the window desired matrix is successfully
      recomputed, and point location is within the window).  In case
      of optional_new_start, we first check if the specified start
      position is feasible, i.e. if it will allow point to be
      displayed in the window.  If using the specified start point
      fails, e.g., if new fonts are needed to be loaded, we abort the
      redisplay cycle and leave it up to the next cycle to figure out
      things.

    . Note that the window's force_start flag is sometimes set by
      redisplay itself, when it decides that the previous window start
      point is fine and should be kept.  Search for "goto force_start"
      below to see the details.  Like the values of window-start
      specified outside of redisplay, these internally-deduced values
      are tested for feasibility, and ignored if found to be
      unfeasible.

    . Note that the function try_window, used to completely redisplay
      a window, accepts the window's start point as its argument.
      This is used several times in the redisplay code to control
      where the window start will be, according to user options such
      as scroll-conservatively, and also to ensure the screen line
      showing point will be fully (as opposed to partially) visible on
      display.  */

The resolved levels are produced by the Emacs bidi reordering engine

VPOS is the zero-based number of the current window's screen line
for which to produce the resolved levels.  If VPOS is nil or omitted,
it defaults to the screen line of point.  If the window displays a
header line, VPOS of zero will report on the header line, and first
line of text in the window will have VPOS of 1.

Value is an array of resolved levels, indexed by glyph number.
Glyphs are numbered from zero starting from the beginning of the
screen line, i.e. the left edge of the window for left-to-right lines
and from the right edge for right-to-left lines.  The resolved levels
are produced only for the window's text area; text in display margins
is not included.

If the selected window's display is not up-to-date, or if the specified
screen line does not display text, this function returns nil.  It is
highly recommended to bind this function to some simple key, like F8,
in order to avoid these problems.

			 Displaying strings
 ***********************************************************************/

/* Display a NUL-terminated string, starting with index START.

   If STRING is non-null, display that C string.  Otherwise, the Lisp
   string LISP_STRING is displayed.  There's a case that STRING is
   non-null and LISP_STRING is not nil.  It means STRING is a string
   data of LISP_STRING.  In that case, we display LISP_STRING while
   ignoring its text properties.

   If FACE_STRING is not nil, FACE_STRING_POS is a position in
   FACE_STRING.  Display STRING or LISP_STRING with the face at
   FACE_STRING_POS in FACE_STRING:

   Display the string in the environment given by IT, but use the
   standard display table, temporarily.

   FIELD_WIDTH is the minimum number of output glyphs to produce.
   If STRING has fewer characters than FIELD_WIDTH, pad to the right
   with spaces.  If STRING has more characters, more than FIELD_WIDTH
   glyphs will be produced.  FIELD_WIDTH <= 0 means don't pad.

   PRECISION is the maximum number of characters to output from
   STRING.  PRECISION < 0  means don't truncate the string.

   This is roughly equivalent to printf format specifiers:

   FIELD_WIDTH	PRECISION	PRINTF
   ----------------------------------------
   -1		-1		%s
   -1		10		%.10s
   10		-1		%10s
   20		10		%20.10s

   MULTIBYTE zero means do not display multibyte chars, > 0 means do
   display them, and < 0 means obey the current buffer's value of
   enable_multibyte_characters.

   Value is the number of columns displayed.  */

     UNIT     - a fixed number of pixels, see below.
     ELEMENT  - size of a display element in pixels, see below.
     (NUM . SPEC) - equals NUM * SPEC
     (+ SPEC SPEC ...)  - add pixel values
     (- SPEC SPEC ...)  - subtract pixel values
     (- SPEC)           - negate pixel value

   NUM ::=
     INT or FLOAT   - a number constant
     SYMBOL         - use symbol's (buffer local) variable binding.

   UNIT ::=
     in       - pixels per inch  *)
     mm       - pixels per 1/1000 meter  *)
     cm       - pixels per 1/100 meter   *)
     width    - width of current font in pixels.
     height   - height of current font in pixels.

     *) using the ratio(s) defined in display-pixels-per-inch.

   ELEMENT ::=

     left-fringe          - left fringe width in pixels
     right-fringe         - right fringe width in pixels

     left-margin          - left margin width in pixels
     right-margin         - right margin width in pixels

     scroll-bar           - scroll-bar area width in pixels

   Examples:

   Pixels corresponding to 5 inches:
     (5 . in)

   Total width of non-text areas on left side of window (if scroll-bar is on left):
     '(space :width (+ left-fringe left-margin scroll-bar))

   Align to first text column (in header line):
     '(space :align-to 0)

   Align to middle of text area minus half the width of variable `my-image'
   containing a loaded image:
     '(space :align-to (0.5 . (- text my-image)))

   Width of left margin minus width of 1 character in the default font:
     '(space :width (- left-margin 1))

   Width of left margin minus width of 2 characters in the current font:
     '(space :width (- left-margin (2 . width)))

   Center 1 character over left-margin (in header line):
     '(space :align-to (+ left-margin (0.5 . left-margin) -0.5))

   Different ways to express width of left fringe plus left margin minus one pixel:
     '(space :width (- (+ left-fringe left-margin) (1)))
     '(space :width (+ left-fringe left-margin (- (1))))
     '(space :width (+ left-fringe left-margin (-1)))

   If ALIGN_TO is NULL, returns the result in *RES.  If ALIGN_TO is
   non-NULL, the value of *ALIGN_TO is a window-relative pixel
   coordinate, and *RES is the additional pixel width from that point
   till the end of the stretch glyph.

   WIDTH_P non-zero means take the width dimension or X coordinate of
   the object specified by PROP, WIDTH_P zero means take the height
   dimension or the Y coordinate.  (Therefore, if ALIGN_TO is
   non-NULL, WIDTH_P should be non-zero.)

   FONT is the font of the face of the surrounding text.
