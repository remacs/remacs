   A sequential implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional algorithm,
   (UBA) as per UAX#9, a part of the Unicode Standard.

   Unlike the Reference Implementation and most other implementations,
   this one is designed to be called once for every character in the
   buffer or string.  That way, we can leave intact the design of the
   Emacs display engine, whereby an iterator object is used to
   traverse buffer or string text character by character, and generate
   the necessary data for displaying each character in 'struct glyph'
   objects.  (See xdisp.c for the details of that iteration.)  The
   functions on this file replace the original linear iteration in the
   logical order of the text with a non-linear iteration in the visual
   order, i.e. in the order characters should be shown on display.

   The main entry point is bidi_move_to_visually_next.  Each time it
   is called, it finds the next character in the visual order, and
   returns its information in a special structure.  The caller is then
   expected to process this character for display or any other
   purposes, and call bidi_move_to_visually_next for the next
   character.  See the comments in bidi_move_to_visually_next for more
   details about its algorithm that finds the next visual-order
   character by resolving their levels on the fly.

   Two other entry points are bidi_paragraph_init and
   bidi_mirror_char.  The first determines the base direction of a
   paragraph, while the second returns the mirrored version of its
   argument character.

   A few auxiliary entry points are used to initialize the bidi
   iterator for iterating an object (buffer or string), push and pop
   the bidi iterator state, and save and restore the state of the bidi
   cache.

   If you want to understand the code, you will have to read it
   together with the relevant portions of UAX#9.  The comments include
   references to UAX#9 rules, for that very reason.

   A note about references to UAX#9 rules: if the reference says
   something like "X9/Retaining", it means that you need to refer to
   rule X9 and to its modifications described in the "Implementation
   Notes" section of UAX#9, under "Retaining Format Codes".

   Here's the overview of the design of the reordering engine
   implemented by this file.

   Basic implementation structure
   ------------------------------

   The sequential processing steps described by UAX#9 are implemented
   as recursive levels of processing, all of which examine the next
   character in the logical order.  This hierarchy of processing looks
   as follows, from the innermost (deepest) to the outermost level,
   omitting some subroutines used by each level:

     bidi_fetch_char         -- fetch next character
     bidi_resolve_explicit   -- resolve explicit levels and directions
     bidi_resolve_weak       -- resolve weak types
     bidi_resolve_brackets   -- resolve "paired brackets" neutral types
     bidi_resolve_neutral    -- resolve neutral types
     bidi_level_of_next_char -- resolve implicit levels

   Each level calls the level below it, and works on the result
   returned by the lower level, including all of its sub-levels.

   Unlike all the levels below it, bidi_level_of_next_char can return
   the information about either the next or previous character in the
   logical order, depending on the current direction of scanning the
   buffer or string.  For the next character, it calls all the levels
   below it; for the previous character, it uses the cache, described
   below.

   Thus, the result of calling bidi_level_of_next_char is the resolved
   level of the next or the previous character in the logical order.
   Based on this information, the function bidi_move_to_visually_next
   finds the next character in the visual order and updates the
   direction in which the buffer is scanned, either forward or
   backward, to find the next character to be displayed.  (Text is
   scanned backwards when it needs to be reversed for display, i.e. if
   the visual order is the inverse of the logical order.)  This
   implements the last, reordering steps of the UBA, by successively
   calling bidi_level_of_next_char until the character of the required
   embedding level is found; the scan direction is dynamically updated
   as a side effect.  See the commentary before the 'while' loop in
   bidi_move_to_visually_next, for the details.

   Fetching characters
   -------------------

   In a nutshell, fetching the next character boils down to calling
   STRING_CHAR_AND_LENGTH, passing it the address of a buffer or
   string position.  See bidi_fetch_char.  However, if the next
   character is "covered" by a display property of some kind,
   bidi_fetch_char returns the u+FFFC "object replacement character"
   that represents the entire run of text covered by the display
   property.  (The ch_len and nchars members of 'struct bidi_it'
   reflect the length in bytes and characters of that text.)  This is
   so we reorder text on both sides of the display property as
   appropriate for an image or embedded string.  Similarly, text
   covered by a display spec of the form '(space ...)', is replaced
   with the u+2029 paragraph separator character, so such display
   specs produce the same effect as a TAB under UBA.  Both these
   special characters are not actually displayed -- the display
   property is displayed instead -- but just used to compute the
   embedding level of the surrounding text so as to produce the
   required effect.

   Bidi iterator states
   --------------------

   The UBA is highly context dependent in some of its parts,
   i.e. results of processing a character can generally depend on
   characters very far away.  The UAX#9 description of the UBA
   prescribes a stateful processing of each character, whereby the
   results of this processing depend on various state variables, such
   as the current embedding level, level stack, and directional
   override status.  In addition, the UAX#9 description includes many
   passages like this (from rule W2 in this case):

     Search backward from each instance of a European number until the
     first strong type (R, L, AL, or sos) is found. If an AL is found,
     change the type of the European number to Arabic number.

   To support this, we use a bidi iterator object, 'struct bidi_it',
   which is a sub-structure of 'struct it' used by xdisp.c (see
   dispextern.h for the definition of both of these structures).  The
   bidi iterator holds the entire state of the iteration required by
   the UBA, and is updated as the text is traversed.  In particular,
   the embedding level of the current character being resolved is
   recorded in the iterator state.  To avoid costly searches backward
   in support of rules like W2 above, the necessary character types
   are also recorded in the iterator state as they are found during
   the forward scan, and then used when such rules need to be applied.
   (Forward scans cannot be avoided in this way; they need to be
   performed at least once, and the results recorded in the iterator
   state, to be reused until the forward scan oversteps the recorded
   position.)

   In this manner, the iterator state acts as a mini-cache of
   contextual information required for resolving the level of the
   current character by various UBA rules.

   Caching of bidi iterator states
   -------------------------------

   As described above, the reordering engine uses the information
   recorded in the bidi iterator state in order to resolve the
   embedding level of the current character.  When the reordering
   engine needs to process the next character in the logical order, it
   fetches it and applies to it all the UBA levels, updating the
   iterator state as it goes.  But when the buffer or string is
   scanned backwards, i.e. in the reverse order of buffer/string
   positions, the scanned characters were already processed during the
   preceding forward scan (see bidi_find_other_level_edge).  To avoid
   costly re-processing of characters that were already processed
   during the forward scan, the iterator states computed while
   scanning forward are cached.

   The cache is just a linear array of 'struct bidi_it' objects, which
   is dynamically allocated and reallocated as needed, since the size
   of the cache depends on the text being processed.  We only need the
   cache while processing embedded levels higher than the base
   paragraph embedding level, because these higher levels require
   changes in scan direction.  Therefore, as soon as we are back to
   the base embedding level, we can free the cache; see the calls to
   bidi_cache_reset and bidi_cache_shrink, for the conditions to do
   this.

   The cache maintains the index of the next unused cache slot -- this
   is where the next iterator state will be cached.  The function
   bidi_cache_iterator_state saves an instance of the state in the
   cache and increments the unused slot index.  The companion function
   bidi_cache_find looks up a cached state that corresponds to a given
   buffer/string position.  All of the cached states must correspond
   1:1 to the buffer or string region whose processing they reflect;
   bidi.c will abort if it finds cache slots that violate this 1:1
   correspondence.

   When the parent iterator 'struct it' is pushed (see push_it in
   xdisp.c) to pause the current iteration and start iterating over a
   different object (e.g., a 'display' string that covers some buffer
   text), the bidi iterator cache needs to be "pushed" as well, so
   that a new empty cache could be used while iterating over the new
   object.  Later, when the new object is exhausted, and xdisp.c calls
   pop_it, we need to "pop" the bidi cache as well and return to the
   original cache.  See bidi_push_it and bidi_pop_it for how this is
   done.

   Some functions of the display engine save copies of 'struct it' in
   local variables, and restore them later.  For examples, see
   pos_visible_p and move_it_in_display_line_to in xdisp.c, and
   window_scroll_pixel_based in window.c.  When this happens, we need
   to save and restore the bidi cache as well, because conceptually
   the cache is part of the 'struct it' state, and needs to be in
   perfect sync with the portion of the buffer/string that is being
   processed.  This saving and restoring of the cache state is handled
   by bidi_shelve_cache and bidi_unshelve_cache, and the helper macros
   SAVE_IT and RESTORE_IT defined on xdisp.c.

   Note that, because reordering is implemented below the level in
   xdisp.c that breaks glyphs into screen lines, we are violating
   paragraph 3.4 of UAX#9. which mandates that line breaking shall be
   done before reordering each screen line separately.  However,
   following UAX#9 to the letter in this matter goes against the basic
   design of the Emacs display engine, and so we choose here this
   minor deviation from the UBA letter in preference to redesign of
   the display engine.  The effect of this is only seen in continued
   lines that are broken into screen lines in the middle of a run
   whose direction is opposite to the paragraph's base direction.

   Important design and implementation note: when the code needs to
   scan far ahead, be sure to avoid such scans as much as possible
   when the buffer/string doesn't contain any RTL characters.  Users
   of left-to-right scripts will never forgive you if you introduce
   some slow-down due to bidi in situations that don't involve any
   bidirectional text.  See the large comment near the beginning of
   bidi_resolve_neutral, for one situation where such shortcut was
   necessary.  */
