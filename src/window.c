`window-size' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer

    `window-height' or `window-width' entry in the alist used by

    temporary buffer via `with-temp-buffer-window' makes a new parent
    window only if `temp-buffer-resize-mode' is enabled.  Otherwise,
    this value is handled like nil.

`temp-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a temporary
    buffer via `with-temp-buffer-window' always makes a new parent
    window.  Otherwise, this value is handled like nil.

`display-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer
    always makes a new parent window.  Since temporary buffers are
    displayed by the function `display-buffer', this value is stronger
    than `temp-buffer'.  Splitting a window for other purpose makes a
    new parent window only if needed.

t means that splitting a window always creates a new parent window.  If
    all splits behave this way, each frame's window tree is a binary
    tree and every window but the frame's root window has exactly one
    sibling.

The default value is `window-size'.  Other values are reserved for
