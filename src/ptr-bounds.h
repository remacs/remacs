/* Pointer bounds checking is a no-op unless running on hardware
   supporting Intel MPX (Intel Skylake or better).  Also, it requires
   GCC 5 and Linux kernel 3.19, or later.  Configure with
   CFLAGS='-fcheck-pointer-bounds -mmpx', perhaps with
   -fchkp-first-field-has-own-bounds thrown in.

   Although pointer bounds checking can help during debugging, it is
   disabled by default because it hurts performance significantly.
   The checking does not detect all pointer errors.  For example, a
   dumped Emacs might not detect a bounds violation of a pointer that
   was created before Emacs was dumped.  */
