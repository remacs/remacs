2013-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* sysdep.c (sys_siglist) [HAVE_DECL___SYS_SIGLIST]:
	Define to __sys_siglist.

2013-07-02  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* xdisp.c (IT_OVERFLOW_NEWLINE_INTO_FRINGE): Don't disallow
	word-wrap, so that overflow-newline-into-fringe would work in
	visual-line-mode.  (Bug#2749)
	(move_it_in_display_line_to): When the last scanned display
	element fits exactly on the display line, and
	overflow-newline-into-fringe is non-nil, but wrap_it is valid,
	don't return MOVE_NEWLINE_OR_CR, but instead back up to the last
	wrap point and return MOVE_LINE_CONTINUED.  Fixes problems with
	finding buffer position that corresponds to pixel coordinates,
	e.g. in buffer_posn_from_coords.

2013-07-02  Jan Djärv  <jan.h.d@swipnet.se>

	* process.c (handle_child_signal): Call catch_child_signal if
	NS_IMPL_GNUSTEP.

2013-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don't convert function pointers to void * and back.
	It isn't portable C, and it's easy enough to avoid.
	* alloc.c: Verify SAVE_FUNCPOINTER bits, too.
	(make_save_value): Add support for SAVE_FUNCPOINTER.
	* keymap.c (map_keymap_char_table_item, map_keymap_internal):
	* print.c (print_object):
	Distinguish function from object pointers.
	* lisp.h (SAVE_FUNCPOINTER): New constant.
	(SAVE_SLOT_BITS): Adjust to it.
	(SAVE_TYPE_FUNCPTR_PTR_OBJ): New constant, replacing
	SAVE_TYPE_PTR_PTR_OBJ.  Change the only use.
	(voidfuncptr): New typedef.
	(struct Lisp_Save_Value): New member data[0].funcpointer.
	(XSAVE_FUNCPOINTER): New function.

	Simplify buildobj processing.
	* Makefile.in (buildobj.h): Make it a sequence of strings each
	followed by comma, rather than a single string.  Put it into a
	.tmp file in case there's an error while generating it.
	(gl-stamp): Use .tmp for temp files.
	(mostlyclean): Clean .tmp files.
	* doc.c (buildobj): Move to just the routine that needs it.
	It's now an array of strings, so processing is simpler.

2013-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug re noninteractive multithreaded memory allocation (Bug#14569).
	* emacs.c (malloc_enable_thread): Hoist extern decl to top level.
	(main) [HAVE_PTHREAD && !SYSTEM_MALLOC && !DOUG_LEA_MALLOC]:
	Invoke malloc_enable_thread even when not interactive.
	Problem reported by Ken Brown in <http://bugs.gnu.org/14569#275>.
	* process.c (init_process_emacs) [CYGWIN]: Tickle glib even
	in this case, since the underlying bug has now been fixed.

2013-07-01  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* emacs.c (Fkill_emacs): Expand Vauto_save_list_file_name before
	unlinking it (bug#14691).

2013-06-30  Michal Nazarewicz  <mina86@mina86.com>

	* buffer.c (FKill_buffer): Run `kill-buffer-query-functions'
	before checking whether buffer is modified.  This lets
	`kill-buffer-query-functions' cancel killing of the buffer or save
	its content before `kill-buffer' asks user the "Buffer %s
	modified; kill anyway?" question.

2013-06-30  Jan Djärv  <jan.h.d@swipnet.se>

	* nsfns.m (handlePanelKeys): Don't process Command+Function keys.
	Let the super performKeyEquivalent deal with them (Bug#14747).

2013-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* widget.c (resize_cb): Remove unused local.

	Do not use GTK 3 if it exists but cannot be compiled.
	* xmenu.c (x_menu_wait_for_event) [!USE_GTK]:
	* xterm.c (x_error_handler) [!USE_GTK]:
	Do not use GTK 3.

	* intervals.c (get_local_map): Actually clip POSITION (Bug#14753).

2013-06-30  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* intervals.c (get_local_map): Instead of aborting, clip POSITION
	to the valid range of values.  (Bug#14753)

	* xdisp.c (Fmove_point_visually): Invalidate the cursor position
	when moving point by using the current glyph matrix.  This avoids
	the need to force redisplay when this function is called in a
	loop.

2013-06-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix minor problems found by static checking.
	* coding.c (encode_inhibit_flag, inhibit_flag): New functions.
	Redo the latter's body to sidestep GCC parenthesization warnings.
	(setup_coding_system, detect_coding, detect_coding_system): Use them.
	* coding.c (detect_coding, detect_coding_system):
	* coding.h (struct undecided_spec):
	Use bool for boolean.
	* image.c (QCmax_width, QCmax_height): Now static.
	* xdisp.c (Fmove_point_visually): Remove unused local.

2013-06-29  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* xdisp.c (Fmove_point_visually): New function.

2013-06-28  Kenichi Handa  <handa@gnu.org>

	* coding.h (define_coding_undecided_arg_index): New enum.
	(coding_attr_index): New members
	coding_attr_undecided_inhibit_null_byte_detection,
	coding_attr_undecided_inhibit_iso_escape_detection,
	coding_attr_undecided_prefer_utf_8.
	(undecided_spec): New struct.
	(struct coding_system): New member `undecided' of the member
	`spec'.

	* coding.c (setup_coding_system): Handle CODING->spec.undecided.
	(detect_coding): Likewise.
	(detect_coding_system): Likewise.
	(Fdefine_coding_system_internal): New coding system properties
	:inhibit-null-byte-detection, :inhibit-iso-escape-detection, and
	:prefer-utf-8.
	(syms_of_coding): Adjust for coding_arg_undecided_max.

2013-06-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* image.c (x_from_xcolors): Remove unused local.

2013-06-28  YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu  <mituharu@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp>

	Defer image data transfer between X client and server until actual
	display happens.

	* dispextern.h (struct image) [HAVE_X_WINDOWS]: New members `ximg'
	and `mask_img'.

	* image.c (Destroy_Image): Remove.
	(x_clear_image_1): New arg `flags' instead of 3 bools `pixmap_p',
	`mask_p', and `colors_p'.  All uses changed.
	(x_clear_image_1) [HAVE_X_WINDOWS]: Destroy `ximg' and `mask_img'.
	(CLEAR_IMAGE_PIXMAP, CLEAR_IMAGE_MASK, CLEAR_IMAGE_COLORS):
	New macros for `flags' arg to x_clear_image_1.
	(postprocess_image, xpm_load_image, x_build_heuristic_mask)
	(png_load_body): Use x_clear_image_1 instead of Free_Pixmap.
	(ZPixmap, XGetImage) [HAVE_NS]: Remove.
	(image_get_x_image_or_dc, image_unget_x_image_or_dc)
	(image_get_x_image, image_unget_x_image): New functions or macros.
	(image_background, image_background_transparent, x_to_xcolors)
	(x_build_heuristic_mask): Use image_get_x_image_or_dc instead of
	XGetImage or CreateCompatibleDC.  Use image_unget_x_image_or_dc
	instead of Destroy_Image.
	(image_create_x_image_and_pixmap, image_put_x_image): New functions.
	(xpm_load_image, x_from_xcolors, x_build_heuristic_mask, pbm_load)
	(png_load_body, jpeg_load_body, tiff_load, gif_load)
	(imagemagick_load_image, svg_load_image): Use them instead of
	x_create_x_image_and_pixmap, and x_put_x_image followed by
	x_destroy_x_image, respectively.
	(xpm_load) [HAVE_XPM && !HAVE_NTGUI]: Use XpmReadFileToImage and
	XpmCreateImageFromBuffer instead of XpmReadFileToPixmap and
	XpmCreatePixmapFromBuffer.  Create pixmaps.  Fill background and
	background_transparent fields.
	(image_sync_to_pixmaps) [HAVE_X_WINDOWS]: New function.
	(prepare_image_for_display, x_disable_image) [HAVE_X_WINDOWS]: Use it.

2013-06-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Do not tickle glib SIGCHLD handling if Cygwin (Bug#14569).
	This mostly consists of undoing recent changes.
	* callproc.c (Fcall_process):
	* process.c (create_process):
	Do not worry about catching SIGCHLD here, undoing previous change.
	* nsterm.m (ns_term_init): Re-catch SIGCHLD, undoing previous change.
	* process.c, process.h (catch_child_signal):
	No longer extern if !NS_IMPL_GNUSTEP, undoing 06-22 change.
	* process.c (catch_child_handler): Don't worry about being called
	lazily and do not assume caller has blocked SIGCHLD, undoing
	previous change.  Move first-time stuff back to
	init_process_emacs, undoing 06-22 change.  If CYGWIN, do not
	tickle glib, as that causes Cygwin bootstrap to fail.  Do not
	set lib_child_handler if it's already initialized, which may
	help avoid problems on GNUStep.

2013-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	A more-conservative workaround for Cygwin SIGCHLD issues (Bug#14569).
	* callproc.c (Fcall_process):
	* process.c (create_process):
	Make sure SIGCHLD is caught before we fork,
	since Emacs startup no arranges to catch SIGCHLD.
	* process.c (lib_child_handler): Initialize to null, not to
	dummy_handler.
	(catch_child_signal): Allow self to be called lazily.
	Do nothing if it's already been called.
	Assume caller has blocked SIGCHLD (all callers do now).
	* emacs.c (main): Do not catch SIGCHLD here; defer it until
	just before it's really needed.
	* nsterm.m (ns_term_init): No need to re-catch SIGCHLD here,
	since it hasn't been caught yet.

2013-06-23  Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

	* image.c (compute_image_size): New function to implement
	:max-width and :max-height.
	(imagemagick_load_image): Use it.

2013-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Try to avoid malloc SEGVs on Cygwin (Bug#14569).
	* callproc.c, process.h (block_child_signal, unblock_child_signal):
	Now extern.
	* emacs.c (main): Catch SIGCHLD just before initializing gfilenotify.
	* process.c (catch_child_signal): Block SIGCHLD while futzing with
	the SIGCHLD handler, since the code is not atomic and (due to glib)
	signals may be arriving now.
	* sysdep.c (init_signals): Do not catch child signals here;
	'main' now does that later, at a safer time.

2013-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Clean up SIGCHLD handling a bit (Bug#14569).
	* process.c, process.h (catch_child_signal):
	Now always extern, even if !NS_IMPL_GNUSTEP.
	* process.c (catch_child_signal): Move glib tickler here from
	init_process_emacs, so that it's done earlier in Emacs
	initialization.  Also move the noninteractive && !initialized
	check here from init_process_emacs.  This is all a bit cleaner for
	GNUish platforms, and I hope it works around the Cygwin bug.
	* sysdep.c (init_signals): Invoke catch_child_signal here, so
	that glib signal handling is tickled before glib creates threads.

	* process.c (wait_reading_process_output): Avoid int overflow
	when reading more than 2 GiB total from a process.

2013-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* process.c (create_process): Handle a couple more cases,
	i.e., work even if new_argv and wait_child_setup[i] are cached.
	Use Fcall_process's style for volatile vars.

2013-06-21  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

	* process.c (create_process): Mark PROCESS volatile.

2013-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use C99-style flexible array members if available.
	This avoids some subtle aliasing issues, which typically
	aren't a problem with GCC but may be a problem elsewhere.
	* alloc.c (sdata): New typedef, replacing the old struct sdata.
	It is a struct if GC_CHECK_STRING_BYTES, a union otherwise.
	In either case, it uses a flexible array member rather than
	the old struct hack.  All uses changed.
	(SDATA_NBYTES, sweep_strings) [!GC_CHECK_STRING_BYTES]:
	Adjust to sdata reorganization.
	* alloc.c (VBLOCK_BYTES_MIN, allocate_vectorlike, Fgarbage_collect):
	Use offsetof (struct, flex_array_member), not sizeof (struct), as
	that ports better to pre-C99 non-GCC.
	* chartab.c (Fmake_char_table, make_sub_char_table, copy_char_table):
	Use CHAR_TABLE_STANDARD_SLOTS rather than its definition,
	as the latter has changed.
	* conf_post.h (FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER): Move here from w32.c,
	and port better to pre-C99 GCC.
	* image.c (struct xpm_cached_color):
	* lisp.h (struct Lisp_Vector, struct Lisp_Bool_Vector)
	(struct Lisp_Char_Table, struct Lisp_Sub_Char_Table):
	Use FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER.
	* lisp.h (string_bytes) [GC_CHECK_STRING_BYTES]:
	Move decl to top level so it gets checked against implementation.
	(CHAR_TABLE_STANDARD_SLOTS): Adjust to struct Lisp_Char_Table change.
	* w32.c (FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER): Move to conf_post.h.

2013-06-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* syntax.c: Integer cleanups.
	(SYNTAX_FLAGS_COMMENT_STYLEC): Return a boolean, not 0-or-2.
	All uses that need 0-or-2 changed to:
	(SYNTAX_FLAGS_COMMENT_STYLEC2): New macro, with the same semantics
	as the old SYNTAX_FLAGS_COMMENT_STYLEC.
	(struct lisp_parse_state, syntax_prefix_flag_p, update_syntax_table)
	(char_quoted, prev_char_comend_first, back_comment)
	(Finternal_describe_syntax_value, skip_chars, skip_syntaxes)
	(in_classes, forw_comment, scan_lists, scan_sexps_forward):
	Use bool for boolean.
	(update_syntax_table, skip_chars, skip_syntaxes):
	Prefer int to unsigned when either will do.
	(back_comment): Return boolean success flag, like forw_comment,
	instead of positive-or-minus-1 (which might have overflowed int anyway).
	Don't stuff ptrdiff_t into int.
	(syntax_spec_code, syntax_code_spec): Now const.
	(Fmatching_paren, scan_lists, scan_sexps_forward):
	Use enum syntaxcode for syntax code.
	(Fmatching_paren): Check that arg is a character, not just an integer.
	(Fstring_to_syntax): Don't assume 0377 fits in enum syntaxcode.
	(Finternal_describe_syntax_value): Omit no-longer-needed
	comparison to 0.
	(skip_chars): Use char, not unsigned char, when the distinction
	doesn't matter.
	(forw_comment, scan_lists): Prefer A |= B to A = A || B when B's cheap.
	* bytecode.c (exec_byte_code):
	* syntax.c (syntax_spec_code, Fchar_syntax)
	(Finternal_describe_syntax_value, skip_chars, skip_syntaxes)
	(init_syntax_once):
	* syntax.h (SYNTAX_WITH_FLAGS):
	Omit unnecessary casts.

2013-06-20  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* w32fns.c (w32_wnd_proc): Don't compute the header line and mode
	line dimensions here, to avoid race conditions with the main
	thread.  (Bug#14062, bug#14630, bug#14669)

	* w32term.c (w32_draw_window_cursor): Compute the header line and
	mode line dimensions here.
	<w32_system_caret_window, w32_system_caret_hdr_height>:
	<w32_system_caret_mode_height>: New variables.

	* w32term.h: Declare them.

2013-06-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* alloc.c (die): Move "assertion failed" string here ...
	* lisp.h (eassert): ... from here.  Also, suppress evaluation of
	COND when SUPPRESS_CHECKING.  This shrinks the executable text
	size by 0.8% to 2.2% when configured with --enable-checking,
	depending on optimization flags (GCC 4.8.1 x86-64).

	* floatfns.c (Flog10): Move to Lisp (marked obsolete there).

2013-06-20  Rüdiger Sonderfeld <ruediger@c-plusplus.de>

	* floatfns.c (Flog) [HAVE_LOG2]: Use log2 if available and if the
	base is 2; this is more accurate.

2013-06-19  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* sound.c (string_default): Move to !WINDOWSNT section.
	(Fplay_sound_internal) [WINDOWSNT]: Remove i_result to avoid warning.

2013-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* sound.c: Integer cleanups.
	Remove unnecessary forward decls.
	(struct sound_device): The 'file' member is now a Lisp_Object, not
	a char *, so that we needn't invoke alloca on a huge size.
	(Fplay_sound_internal): Adjust to this.
	(string_default): New function.
	(vox_open, vox_init, alsa_open, alsa_configure, alsa_init):
	Use it to adjust to the struct sound_device change.
	(parse_sound, wav_init, au_init, alsa_init): Use bool for booleans.
	(be2hs) [0]: Remove.

	* syntax.c (skip_chars): Don't use uninitialized storage
	when searching a multibyte buffer for characters that are not in a
	unibyte string that contains non-ASCII characters.

2013-06-18  Jan Djärv  <jan.h.d@swipnet.se>

	* process.c: Include xgselect.h if HAVE_GLIB.  Include glib.h
	if HAVE_GLIB && ! WINDOWSNT (Bug#14654).

2013-06-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* conf_post.h: Add comments for INLINE, EXTERN_INLINE, etc.

2013-06-18  Kenichi Handa  <handa@gnu.org>

	* font.c (Ffont_spec): Signal an error for an invalid font name
	(Bug#14648).

2013-06-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Porting fixes for merged specpdl and backtrace stacks (Bug#14643).
	In particular this ports to 32-bit sparc Sun cc.
	* eval.c (init_eval_once, grow_specpdl): Allocate a specbinding
	array with a dummy element at specpdl[-1], so that its address can
	be taken portably.
	(unbind_to): Do not copy the binding; not needed, now that we
	copy old_value in the one place where the copy is needed.
	* fileio.c (Fwrite_region): Use ptrdiff_t, not int, for specpdl count.
	* lisp.h (BITS_PER_PTRDIFF_T): Remove; no longer needed.
	(union specbinding): Rename from struct specbinding.  Redo layout
	to avoid the need for 'ptrdiff_t nargs : BITS_PER_PTRDIFF_T - 1;',
	which is not portable.  With Sun C 5.12 32-bit sparc, the
	declaration causes nargs to be an unsigned bitfield, a behavior
	that the C standard allows; but Emacs wants nargs to be signed.
	The overall type is now a union of structures rather than a
	structure of union of structures, and the 'kind' member is now a
	bitfield, so that the overall type doesn't grow.  All uses changed.
	* process.c (Fmake_serial_process): Remove unnecessary initialization.

2013-06-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* frame.c (x_report_frame_params): Cast parent_desc to uintptr_t.
	Needed if HAVE_NTGUI.  Reported by Juanma Barranquero.

	* nsfont.m (ns_registry_to_script): Parenthesize while expression.

2013-06-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* w32fns.c (w32_wnd_proc): Don't call WINDOW_HEADER_LINE_HEIGHT
	unless we know that the window w's frame is a frame object.
	Another attempt at solving bug#14062 and bug#14630.

2013-06-17  Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@gnus.org>

	* textprop.c (property_set_type): New enum.
	(add_properties): Allow appending/prepending text properties.
	(add_text_properties_1): Factored out of Fadd_text_properties.
	(Fadd_text_properties): Move all the code into
	add_text_properties_1.
	(Fadd_face_text_property): New function that calls
	add_text_properties_1.

2013-06-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Move functions from lisp.h to individual modules when possible.
	From a suggestion by Andreas Schwab in <http://bugs.gnu.org/11935#68>.
	* alloc.c (XFLOAT_INIT, set_symbol_name):
	* buffer.c (CHECK_OVERLAY):
	* chartab.c (CHECK_CHAR_TABLE, set_char_table_ascii)
	(set_char_table_parent):
	* coding.c (CHECK_NATNUM_CAR, CHECK_NATNUM_CDR):
	* data.c (BOOLFWDP, INTFWDP, KBOARD_OBJFWDP, OBJFWDP, XBOOLFWD)
	(XKBOARD_OBJFWD, XINTFWD, XOBJFWD, CHECK_SUBR, set_blv_found)
	(blv_value, set_blv_value, set_blv_where, set_blv_defcell)
	(set_blv_valcell):
	* emacs.c (setlocale) [!HAVE_SETLOCALE]:
	* eval.c (specpdl_symbol, specpdl_old_value, specpdl_where)
	(specpdl_arg, specpdl_func, backtrace_function, backtrace_nargs)
	(backtrace_args, backtrace_debug_on_exit):
	* floatfns.c (CHECK_FLOAT):
	* fns.c (CHECK_HASH_TABLE, CHECK_LIST_END)
	(set_hash_key_and_value, set_hash_next, set_hash_next_slot)
	(set_hash_hash, set_hash_hash_slot, set_hash_index)
	(set_hash_index_slot):
	* keymap.c (CHECK_VECTOR_OR_CHAR_TABLE):
	* marker.c (CHECK_MARKER):
	* textprop.c (CHECK_STRING_OR_BUFFER):
	* window.c (CHECK_WINDOW_CONFIGURATION):
	Move here from lisp.h, and make these functions static rather than
	extern inline.
	* buffer.c (Qoverlayp):
	* data.c (Qsubrp):
	* fns.c (Qhash_table_p):
	* window.c (Qwindow_configuration_p):
	Now static.
	* lisp.h: Remove the abovementioned defns and decls.

	Use functions, not macros, for XINT etc. (Bug#11935).
	In lisp.h, prefer functions to function-like macros, and
	constants to object-like macros, when either will do.  This:
	 . simplifies use, as there's no more need to worry about
	   arguments' side effects being evaluated multiple times.
	 . makes the code easier to debug on some platforms.
	However, when using gcc -O0, keep using function-like macros
	for a few critical operations, for performance reasons.
	This sort of thing isn't needed with gcc -Og, but -Og
	is a GCC 4.8 feature and isn't widely-enough available yet.
	* alloc.c (gdb_make_enums_visible) [USE_LSB_TAG]:
	Remove enum lsb_bits; no longer needed.
	(allocate_misc, free_misc): Don't use XMISCTYPE as an lvalue.
	* buffer.c (Qoverlap):
	* data.c (Qsubrp):
	* fns.c (Qhash_table_p):
	Now extern, so lisp.h can use these symbols.
	* dispextern.h: Include character.h, for MAX_CHAR etc.
	(GLYPH, GLYPH_CHAR, GLYPH_FACE, SET_GLYPH_CHAR, SET_GLYPH_FACE)
	(SET_GLYPH, GLYPH_CODE_CHAR, GLYPH_CODE_FACE)
	(SET_GLYPH_FROM_GLYPH_CODE, GLYPH_MODE_LINE_FACE, GLYPH_CHAR_VALID_P)
	(GLYPH_CODE_P): Move here from lisp.h.
	(GLYPH_CHAR, GLYPH_FACE, GLYPH_CODE_CHAR, GLYPH_CODE_FACE)
	(GLYPH_CHAR_VALID_P, GLYPH_CODE_P): Now functions, not macros.
	(GLYPH_MODE_LINE_FACE): Now enums, not macros.

	get-char-property the window that is being rendered, instead of
	the buffer, to support window-specific overlays.  (Bug#14575)
	(compute_display_string_pos): When W is NULL, use the current
	buffer as the object to pass to get-char-property.
	(Fcurrent_bidi_paragraph_direction): Assign NULL to the window
	pointer member of the bidi iterator, since no window is pertinent
	to this function.

2013-06-08  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	GLIB may be linked in due to rsvg, but ns_select must be called.

	* xgselect.c (xg_select): Remove call to window_system_available
	and g_main_context_pending at the top, so Gdk events (i.e. file
	notify) are processed when Emacs is started with -nw.

2013-06-07  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in (ctagsfiles1, ctagsfiles2): Don't include *.m files.
	(ctagsfiles3): New variable, includes only *.m files.
	(TAGS): Use an explicit language name in the regular expressions,
	to avoid transformation of '/SOMETHING' by MSYS to
	'c:\MSYS\SOMETHING'.

	Simplify building of lisp with alternative tails.
	(Fgfile_add_watch, Fgfile_rm_watch):
	Do not assume glib functions set errno reliably on failure.
	(Fgfile_add_watch): Check that the monitor survives the XIL trick,
	and signal an error otherwise.

	Use Fdelq instead of Fdelete, for speed.

	Don't highlight when mouse-highlight is nil.
	(note_mouse_highlight): When mouse-highlight is nil, don't return
	right away; instead, run tool-bar and mode-line highlight
	subroutine, clear any existing highlight, and revert the mouse
	pointer to its default shape.  (Bug#14558)

2013-06-05  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lisp.mk (lisp): Add prog-mode.el.

2013-06-03  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* w32console.c (initialize_w32_display): Return the dimensions of
	the console window via 2 additional arguments, not via the current
	frame.  This avoids crashes due to overrunning the bounds of

	* eval.c (set_backtrace_debug_on_exit): Now static.

	sequence is encountered, reset the invocation and designation
	status to the safest one.

2013-04-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Makefile.in (bootstrap-clean): Remove stamp-h1 too.
	Without this fix, "make distclean" leaves stamp-h1 behind.

2013-04-20  Erik Charlebois  <erikcharlebois@gmail.com>

	* w32fns.c (w32_fullscreen_rect): New function to compute the
	window rectangle for the given fullscreen mode.
	(w32_wnd_proc): When in a fullscreen mode, WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING no
	longer tunes the window size.  This keeps the window's edges flush
	with the screen and allows the taskbar to hide itself in fullboth.

	* w32term.c (w32fullscreen_hook): 'fullboth' now shows without
	window decorations and uses the entire screen.

	* w32term.h  (w32_fullscreen_rect) Add prototype.
	(struct w32_output): Replace normal_width, normal_height,
	normal_top, and normal_left members with a single normal_placement
	struct.
	(FRAME_NORMAL_WIDTH, FRAME_NORMAL_HEIGHT, FRAME_NORMAL_TOP):
	Remove macros.
	(FRAME_NORMAL_PLACEMENT): New macro.

	* buffer.c (syms_of_buffer) <left-margin-width, right-margin-width>
	<left-fringe-width, right-fringe-width, fringes-outside-margins>:
	Mention in the doc string that setting these variables takes
	effect only after a call to set-window-buffer.  (Bug#14200)

2013-04-13  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* indent.c (Fvertical_motion): Don't consider display strings on
	overlay strings as display strings on the buffer position we
	started from.  This prevents vertical cursor motion from jumping
	more than one line when there's an overlay string with a display
	property at end of line.
	Reported by Karl Chen <Karl.Chen@quarl.org> in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2013-04/msg00362.html.

	* window.c (Fwindow_end): Test more flags, including the buffer's
	last_overlay_modified flag, to determine whether the window's
	display is really up-to-date.  Prevents the function from
	returning a stale value.  (Bug#14170)
	(Fwindow_line_height): Fix the test for up-to-date-ness of the
	current matrix.

2013-04-10  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* frame.c (do_switch_frame): Mark the TTY frame we switch to as
	garbaged only if it is not already the top frame on its TTY.
	This prevents flickering due to constant redrawing of TTY frames when
	there are GUI frames open in the same session.  (Bug#13864)

2013-04-10  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* keyboard.c (timer_start_idle): Call internal-timer-start-idle instead

	* fileio.c (ACL_NOT_WELL_SUPPORTED): New macro copied from gnulib.
	(Fcopy_file, Fset_file_acl) [HAVE_POSIX_ACL]: Use it.

2013-03-31  Jan Djärv  <jan.h.d@swipnet.se>

	* nsterm.m (ns_mouse_position): Use NS_FRAME_P instead of checking
	f->output_data.ns.

2013-04-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix --enable-profiling bug introduced by 2013-02-25 change (Bug#13783).
	This bug was introduced by my 2013-02-25 change that simplified
	data_start configuration.  Without this change, on GNU/Linux
	an Emacs configured with --enable-profiling fails immediately
	due to a profiler signal.
	* Makefile.in: Compile with $(PROFILING_CFLAGS), but do not link
	with these flags.  On platforms where special flags are needed
	when linking temacs, the flags are now in LD_SWITCH_SYSTEM_TEMACS.
	(ALL_CFLAGS): Remove $(PROFILING_CFLAGS).
	(.c.o, .m.o): Compile with $(PROFILING_CFLAGS).

2013-03-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Static checking by GCC 4.8-20130319.
	* image.c (gif_load): Assume pass < 3 to pacify GCC.

2013-03-24  Ken Brown  <kbrown@cornell.edu>

	* w32fns.c (emacs_abort) [CYGWIN]: Define `_open' as a macro to
	fix compilation on 64-bit Cygwin, where underscores are not
	automatically prepended.

	* w32term.c (w32_initialize): Silence compiler warning.

2013-03-23  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* w32term.c (w32fullscreen_hook): Use FRAME_NORMAL_WIDTH,
	FRAME_NORMAL_HEIGHT, and FRAME_PREV_FSMODE, instead of static
	variables, to save and restore frame dimensions.
	Use FRAME_NORMAL_LEFT and FRAME_NORMAL_TOP to restore frame position
	after returning from a 'fullscreen' configuration.
	use SendMessage instead of PostMessage to send the SC_RESTORE message,
	to avoid races between the main thread and the input thread.

	* w32term.h (struct w32_output): New members normal_width,
	normal_height, normal_top, normal_left, and prev_fsmode.
	(FRAME_NORMAL_WIDTH, FRAME_NORMAL_HEIGHT, FRAME_NORMAL_TOP)
	(FRAME_NORMAL_LEFT, FRAME_PREV_FSMODE): New macros to access these
	members of a frame.

	* w32term.c (w32fullscreen_hook): Record last value of the frame's
	'fullscreen' parameter.  Always record previous width and height
	of the frame, except when switching out of maximized modes, so
	that they could be restored correctly, instead of resetting to the
	default frame dimensions.  Send SC_RESTORE command to the frame,
	unless we are going to send SC_MAXIMIZE, to restore the frame
	resize hints in the mouse pointer shown by the window manager.
	(Bug#14032)

	* frame.c (get_frame_param): Now extern for WINDOWSNT as well.

	(fset_menu_bar_window):
	* dispnew.c (clear_current_matrices, clear_desired_matrices)
	(free_glyphs, update_frame):
	* xdisp.c (expose_frame): Likewise.
	(display_menu_bar): Likewise.  Remove redundant eassert.
	* window.h (WINDOW_MENU_BAR_P): Always define to 0 if X
	toolkit is in use.

2013-03-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use functions and constants to manipulate Lisp_Save_Value objects.
	This replaces code that used macros and strings and token-pasting.

	* print.c (PRINTX): Remove.

	* alloc.c: Remove redundant static declarations.

2013-03-20  Dmitry Antipov  <dmantipov@yandex.ru>

	* window.h (struct window): Convert left_col, top_line, total_lines

	New functions to provide defaults when no window system available.
	(FRAME_RES_X, FRAME_RES_Y): New macros.

	as return type of image_background.  (Bug#13981)
	* image.c (RGB_PIXEL_COLOR): Move to dispextern.h.

2013-03-16  Jan Djärv  <jan.h.d@swipnet.se>

	arg text_at_gap_tail.  Cancel the code for handling it.

	* coding.h (struct coding_system): New member eol_seen.

	* coding.c (detect_ascii): New function.
	(detect_coding): Set coding->head_ascii and coding->eol_seen only
	when the source bytes are actually scanned.  On detecting for
	coding_category_utf_8_auto, call detect_ascii instead of scanning
	source bytes directly.
	(produce_chars): Call insert_from_gap with the new arg 0.
	(encode_coding): Likewise.
	(decode_coding_gap): Control ASCII optimization by the variable
	disable_ascii_optimization instead of #ifndef .. #endif.

2013-03-14  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* w32term.c (w32_read_socket) <WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED>: Remove old
	and incorrect code.  Treat WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED like WM_ACTIVATE
	and WM_ACTIVATEAPP.
	(w32fullscreen_hook): If the frame is visible, reset

	frame is not visible, set f->want_fullscreen to FULLSCREEN_WAIT.
	(Bug#13953)

2013-03-13  Daniel Colascione  <dancol@dancol.org>

	* emacs.c (main): Call syms_of_cygw32 on CYGWIN non-NTGUI builds
	too so that these builds can use Cygwin's file conversion
	functions.  (We've been building and linking cygw32.o all along
	and just not using it.)

2013-03-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	File synchronization fixes (Bug#13944).

2013-03-13  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* w32term.c (w32_read_socket): If the Emacs frame is being
	activated, call w32fullscreen_hook, to make sure the new frame
	dimensions are in effect.  (Bug#13937)

2013-03-13  Dmitry Antipov  <dmantipov@yandex.ru>

	* xdisp.c (init_iterator): Simplify because both character and byte
	positions are either specified or -1.  Add eassert.  Adjust comment.
	* window.c (Fscroll_other_window): Use SET_PT_BOTH because both
	character and byte positions can be obtained from marker.

2013-03-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Static checking by Sun C 5.12.
	* alloc.c (buffer_memory_full) [REL_ALLOC]:
	* bytecode.c (exec_byte_code):
	* dispnew.c (init_display):
	* eval.c (error):
	* fileio.c (Fsubstitute_in_file_name):

	* keymap.c (Fsingle_key_description):
	* term.c (maybe_fatal, fatal):
	* xfns.c (Fx_display_backing_store, Fx_display_visual_class):
	* xsmfns.c (Fhandle_save_session):
	Omit unreachable code.
	* keymap.c (map_keymap_char_table_item): Cast void * to
	a function pointer type; the C Standard requires this.

	* sysdep.c: Remove a use of BSD_SYSTEM, which I'm trying to phase out.
	Include <sys/param.h> unconditionally, as that works elsewhere and
	is simpler here.  Include <sys/sysctl.h> if DARWIN_OS ||
	__FreeBSD__, not if BSD_SYSTEM, since it's needed only for Darwin
	and FreeBSD now.
