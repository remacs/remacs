/* Emacs uses special text property `composition' to support character
   composition.  A sequence of characters that have the same (i.e. eq)
   `composition' property value is treated as a single composite
   sequence (we call it just `composition' here after).  Characters in
   a composition are all composed somehow on the screen.

   The property value has this form when the composition is made:
	((LENGTH . COMPONENTS) . MODIFICATION-FUNC)
   then turns to this form:
	(COMPOSITION-ID . (LENGTH COMPONENTS-VEC . MODIFICATION-FUNC))
   when the composition is registered in composition_hash_table and
   composition_table.  These rather peculiar structures were designed
   to make it easy to distinguish them quickly (we can do that by
   checking only the first element) and to extract LENGTH (from the
   former form) and COMPOSITION-ID (from the latter form).

   We register a composition when it is displayed, or when the width
   is required (for instance, to calculate columns).

   LENGTH -- Length of the composition.  This information is used to
	check the validity of the composition.

   COMPONENTS --  Character, string, vector, list, or nil.

	If it is nil, characters in the text are composed relatively
	according to their metrics in font glyphs.

	If it is a character or a string, the character or characters
	in the string are composed relatively.

	If it is a vector or list of integers, the element is a
	character or an encoded composition rule.  The characters are
	composed according to the rules.  (2N)th elements are
	characters to be composed and (2N+1)th elements are
	composition rules to tell how to compose (2N+2)th element with
	the previously composed 2N glyphs.

   COMPONENTS-VEC -- Vector of integers.  In a relative composition,
	the elements are the characters to be composed.  In a rule-base
	composition, the elements are characters or encoded
	composition rules.

   MODIFICATION-FUNC -- If non nil, it is a function to call when the
	composition gets invalid after a modification in a buffer.  If
	it is nil, a function in `composition-function-table' of the
	first character in the sequence is called.

   COMPOSITION-ID --Identification number of the composition.  It is
	used as an index to composition_table for the composition.

   When Emacs has to display a composition or has to know its
   displaying width, the function get_composition_id is called.  It
   returns COMPOSITION-ID so that the caller can access the
   information about the composition through composition_table.  If a
   COMPOSITION-ID has not yet been assigned to the composition,
   get_composition_id checks the validity of `composition' property,
   and, if valid, assigns a new ID, registers the information in
   composition_hash_table and composition_table, and changes the form
   of the property value.  If the property is invalid,
   get_composition_id returns -1 without changing the property value.

   We use two tables to keep the information about composition;
   composition_hash_table and composition_table.

   The former is a hash table whose keys are COMPONENTS-VECs and
   values are the corresponding COMPOSITION-IDs.  This hash table is
   weak, but as each key (COMPONENTS-VEC) is also kept as a value of the
   `composition' property, it won't be collected as garbage until all
   bits of text that have the same COMPONENTS-VEC are deleted.

   The latter is a table of pointers to `struct composition' indexed
   by COMPOSITION-ID.  This structure keeps the other information (see
   composite.h).

   In general, a text property holds information about individual
   characters.  But, a `composition' property holds information about
   a sequence of characters (in this sense, it is like the `intangible'
   property).  That means that we should not share the property value
   in adjacent compositions -- we can't distinguish them if they have the
   same property.  So, after any changes, we call
   `update_compositions' and change a property of one of adjacent
   compositions to a copy of it.  This function also runs a proper
   composition modification function to make a composition that gets
   invalid by the change valid again.

   As the value of the `composition' property holds information about a
   specific range of text, the value gets invalid if we change the
   text in the range.  We treat the `composition' property as always
   rear-nonsticky (currently by setting default-text-properties to
   (rear-nonsticky (composition))) and we never make properties of
   adjacent compositions identical.  Thus, any such changes make the
   range just shorter.  So, we can check the validity of the `composition'
   property by comparing LENGTH information with the actual length of
   the composition.

For each character that has to be composed automatically with
preceding and/or following characters, this char-table contains
a function to call to compose that character.

The element at index C in the table, if non-nil, is a list of
composition rules of this form: ([PATTERN PREV-CHARS FUNC] ...)

PATTERN is a regular expression which C and the surrounding
characters must match.

PREV-CHARS is a non-negative integer (less than 4) specifying how many
characters before C to check the matching with PATTERN.  If it is 0,
PATTERN must match C and the following characters.  If it is 1,
PATTERN must match a character before C and the following characters.

If PREV-CHARS is 0, PATTERN can be nil, which means that the
single character C should be composed.

FUNC is a function to return a glyph-string representing a
composition of the characters that match PATTERN.  It is
called with one argument GSTRING.

GSTRING is a template of a glyph-string to return.  It is already
filled with a proper header for the characters to compose, and
glyphs corresponding to those characters one by one.  The
function must return a new glyph-string with the same header as
GSTRING, or modify GSTRING itself and return it.
