# Gnulib modules to be omitted from Emacs.

# Omit them because they either conflict with MinGW headers or
# headers in nt/inc, or because those modules won't compile with
# MinGW, or because Emacs already has the corresponding facilities as
# part of Emacs sources, and their implementation is incompatible with
# Gnulib's.
#
# In general, do NOT omit modules that
# don't need to be omitted, to minimize the differences from
# upstream gnulib.mk and thus make the maintenance easier.  Every
# header file whose generation is controlled by configure-time tests
# does NOT need to be removed; instead, force the configure script to
# accept whatever MinGW has to offer, by defining the appropriate
# Autoconf variable in the nt/mingw-cfg.site file.  Headers that are
# generated conditionally have the tell-tale "ifneq (,$(GL_GENERATE_foo_H))"
# condition before their Makefile snippet in this file.  Likewise, do
# NOT remove gnulib modules which introduce header files that don't
# exist in MinGW and in nt/inc/, since they cannot possibly clash
# with anything.  Gnulib modules that introduce source *.c files also
# need not be removed; if they define functions that could clash with
# the w32 substitutes in Emacs, disable their compilation by defining
# suitable variables in nt/mingw-cfg.site.
